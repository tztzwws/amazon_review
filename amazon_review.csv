4,"Thank you ever so much, Turbo Tax for making taxes a walk in the park. I was able to read the Sunday comics with one eye while filling out my taxes with the other. I am so looking forward to spending my state refund. I was a little disappointed that my federal return fell a little short. But I will learn frm my mistakes and bring my A-game for the 2015 competition."
4,"I have been using Cook'n since version 7. It is an easy program to learn and use with lots of options. I live in Australia so the measures are metric rather than imperial. Last year I lost a good deal of data (includinging my personal recipe files) from a failed computer. This SHOULD have taught me a lesson.<br /><br />When I upgraded to Version 10, I had difficulties restoring my databases. This is not the fault of Cook'n, rather my own lack of diligence with backing up data appropriately. I have to start from scratch AGAIN with my Cook'n. Some recipes are lost forever I feel but maybe I have learnt with time to make appropriate backups.<br /><br />Getting back to the program, it can be as simple or as complicated as you like. I do not use menus or indeed shopping lists most of the time but I still come back to Cook'n for its ease of use and flexibility.<br /><br />The only beef I have with Cook'n is the printing side of things. As I am in Australia, paper sizes are not the same as the US but with a little tweaking, I can get around that. More printing options would be nice but that's on the wishlist.<br /><br />I must say that DVO's customer service is great. I lost my purchased cookbooks but the DVO team were able to resend me what ones they could considering that I purchased them over 4 years ago. What book they couldn't send me, they offered a free download of any book I liked. All this done in a matter of 2 short days and only a couple of emails. Thanks Ryan, you are a legend and a lifesaver."
2,"I ordered backup by StompSoft, because I had one at home. You sent backup by Migo. I notified you. You sent me another shipment of the same thing, backup by Migo. And told me I would be charged for the second shipment, too, if I didn't return the one by some deadline. I am still evaluating the one to see if it will do, or just not do. I get limited access time at the customers site and backups take a long time and have to run off hours. Backups I get but auto scheduling is not yet working. Rich"
5,I recently updated my internet security and the Norton 2010 package was very easy to install on my 3 home based PC's. Its worth the peace of mind protection and comes as one of if not THE highest rated products of its kind.
2,"I have used five generations of Adobe Premiere, all the way back to version 1.5. While it is still a good editor with some strong features, the latest version, PE 10 flagrantly misrepresents its capability. It states on the box \\""Burn Blu-ray quality HD movies using standard DVD discs and burners.\\"" This statement is under the heading \\""Share videos...with friends wherever they are\\"". The problem is that your friends will have to buy a new \\""1080 HD DVD Player\\"" in order to take advantage of this feature. Adobe does not specify that their new feature requires new hardware and therefore it is misleading and caused me to waste a good deal of time trying to find an explanation on their website. Not to mention that the claim that it works with any HD video camera is simply not true. It worked with my older camcorders, but not my new Sony.<br />On the other hand, the software does a fine job of basic editing and is particularly good at rendering discs because it has good control over the menu text and icon placement and has an excellent DVD preview screen so you don't have to burn DVDs to know if your menus launch the scenes correctly. Rendering to all formats is impressively fast and the Win 7 64 bit implementation is robust and only crashes occasionally.<br />More problems with PE are caused by Adobe's strategy to attempt to persuade users to use this product as the nexus of all their stored video and still media. Anybody who is serious about video editing will have a host of programs including viewers, converters and other editors. PE's cumbersome attempt to grab all the media files results in screens popping up unexpectedly that take you out of the core editing experience. This was never the case in the older products. Bad product direction for serious video editors. Also bothersome are their frequent attempts to pull users into using the related suite of Photoshop products, no doubt because they are losing market share to Picasa and other free photo editing programs.<br />This product is now no better than the Cyberlink competitor and the only reason I remain an Adobe user is that I am familiar with their menus."
5,Can't imagine doing taxes without it. Have been using TaxCut for years and ordered the same version on autopilot. Doh. Moved to FL last year. Not much use for the state vesrions in FL! Oh Well.
1,"QuickBooks Pro 2006 for Mac is a dreadful option. Simply: it is complicated to use because it requires an entirely different software product for payroll (Aatrix), and it requires lots of customer support since neither the software or informational booklet are not terribly user-friendly. When calling QuickBooks customer support, you're calling India phonebanks and holding on the phone for 1.5 hrs or more until a live voice is heard. Aatrix customer support, while informative and patient, requires the same long wait times. Both lines feature \\""hold\\"" music that is guaranteed to give you a bad hair day and re-cycles frequently. Recommendation for a much better accounting product: MYOB <br /> <br />Bernie Krause, PhD"
4,"Numbers is the weakest point of the iWork suite. As far as I can tell, there is no text-to-columns function. I tend to drop down to perl or perl + SQL for heavy math, so other missing functions don't bother me. The lack of text-to-columns makes importing data from a SQL query or the command line harder than it needs to be.<br /><br />Still, iWork is a great value. I'm glad I bought it, and recommend it to anyone with a mac."
5,I would recommend this to everyone that wants to learn how to type or increase their speed in typing. I just love it.
4,"I have been using the Microsoft Office products since their introduction many years ago. This upgrade (2007) looks and feels somewhat different than past versions, but once you get used to it...it is fine...even better than before because a lot of the commonly used functionality is right up front, not buried in sub-menus. The help function is much more user friendly as well. Great Product!"
5,"Webroot is one of the best anti-virus/firewall, etc... on the market. It has tremendous done work for me in finding numerous threats and taking care of them right away. I would recommend it the highest level because it does a great job.<br /><br />Thanks"
1,"Review of Smith Micro's Poser Pro Well, at this juncture I've been working almost daily with this product, and thought it was high time I shared some of my impressions with other prospective customers/victims. First of all, as a long-time software professional, I am quite aware of the complexities associated with 3D rendering, and the high demand on processing resources -- both memory and CPU. Even though I'm running a fairly capable machine (quad-core, 64-bit, 8Gig of ram, 2 - 1-terrabyte drives, Win XP-64, etc.), I am prepared to accept that complex 3D scene rendering will take some time. That said, what I DO NOT accept is the necessity for the program to outright refuse to render, or even LOAD some scenes, reporting \\""not enough memory to load texture map'! In software engineering terminology, this just indicates sloppy memory management. Even after researching the issues, tweaking the render settings, running a 3rd-party memory management utility -- the problem persists. Perhaps even harder to excuse is the generally brittle nature of the package. It regularly becomes necessary to resort to ctl-alt-del, bring up the program manager, find the process, and use the \\""kill process tree\\"" command to get rid of the hung application, and then start the whole process over from the start, often losing work in the process. Then, of course, there are the incessant \\""An unexpected exception occurred: -50\\"" messages. Once again, ctrl-alt-del, etc., is the only way to proceed. Don't even bother looking in the event manager, or searching for a log that might explain the source of the problem. The Poser \\""engineers\\"" apparently considered such niceties as superfluous. Interestingly, it's often possible (and necessary) to load a scene that Poser Pro refuses to accept by using Poser 7! I can then eliminate some elements, save the file, and reload back into Poser Pro. Did someone decide it was necessary to introduce some additional bugs into the flagship package.? Ialso have a strong suspicion that the program suffers from some severe memory leaks. If you monitor memory usage, you'll see that, regardless of the nature of the scene, memory usage just keeps on increasing, until, inevitably -- that's right: ctrl-alt-del. The thing that amazes me most, is the proliferation of gushing reviews of this shoddy piece of . . . programming. Are the reviewers on Smith Micro's payroll? Have they done any more with it than render a quick naked woman, gawk over it, and then write: \\""WOW, what a GREAT product!\\""? There are, of course, so many other annoying quirks as to defy enumeration here. Suffice it to say, that this is an extremely irritating program with which to work. Smith Micro touts this as a \\""professional package,\\"" an utterly absurd assertion. It's quality is such that I might overlook the bugs in a freeware package, but certainly not in something costing nearly five-hundred bucks. Oh well, there's a sucker born every minute. Now, as someone who has watched my own company's profits eroded by software piracy, I am generally opposed to such abuses, however, in cases like this, my advice is to acquire the product from someplace like Emule, or Vuse, or other torrent servers, use it for a while, and if you still think it's worth the asking price, then by all means, write that check. Otherwise, just use it at a cost that's precisely what it's worth: $0."
5,The Expositors Bible Commentary 5.0 software is easy to use and contains exceptional detail of Bible book introductions. The overviews that I have examined so far are full of usaable background material. The individual comments have been helpful. The whole package is to be commended for general use re Bible knowledge and is of use for teaching purposes/
3,"Works ok on Mac. As other reviewers have stated elsewhere the windows version works smoother and this version is not as robust as the one it replaces. That being said it does what it is supposed to but.... the days of the Microsoft Office being a needed program are fading fast. With open office and the word processor already on Mac (pages) along with open office and of course google docs I can see the day when they will hardly be able to give Microsoft Office away. Pages does the just about the same thing cheaper and Pages is the one I use most,"
5,"I've been looking for a product like this all my working life. I started with OneNote 2003 and upgraded to 2007 as soon as it was available. I use it daily for everything from my To-Do list, to a daily journal for work and personal. It is handy to store the multitude of projects, notes, operating instructions, help desk notes, network notes, passwords, etc. I will never understand why Microsoft doesn't just include this with every Office package. It is like a best-kept secret. Hard to sell my office mates and bosses on this product when it costs extra to buy to add on to most Office packages. Come on Microsoft, this product is not only for students. Just about everyone in business could use this and it would be a wonderful product for collabrative notes in most businesses!"
5,"For me this product is much better than the new Microsoft programs. Windows 8 does makes it a little difficult to use in that it takes a few extra steps to save, but well worth the extra effort."
3,"Received with ScanSnap S1500. Goods: 1. Relatively easy to use and organize without having to use windows file system. Good for the non-computer geek who just wants to get rid of the paper but have a things organized in binders and folders. Others: 1. To attempt to minimize software piracy (I don't blame them) there is a relatively complex installation which failed in my case on several attempts. Support helped me get around this problem within a few days and were very helpful and responsive. But, if I ever need to reinstall or move to another computer (if you are scanning your life aren't you going to take it with you to the next computer?) I can expect it to be difficult. 2. The main problem with this program is the proprietary database. The file and folder naming structure in windows is not representative of what you called the files and folders in the program when you scanned them (unlike the default program that comes with the scanner). This mean that you need to use the program to find the files and if you ever no longer have this program or access to it (see number 1 above or if you are using Windows 10 ten years from now and this program is no longer supportable), all your scanning work will be for naught and you will have a bunch of folders and files with gobledegook for names. Good luck finding that birth certificate then!"
5,Great product. My children and I use this to brush up on our typing skills. I would recommend this product.
3,"BEWARE of Tech support from INDIA they will ask you a fee of 200.00 but then when you say<br />He** no they will reduce it to 99.00, They are scammers the INDIA TECHNICIANS ARE"
4,Great for little ones but doesn't run on Windows 7. Be reminded that some of these older titles don't work with the new operating systems! Otherwise it is such a cute game. I am sure they will come out with updates.
4,"I've used Nuance Paperport pro V12 and the bundled PDF program for a while on an older XP computer (soon to be retired).<br /><br />Power PDF is a significant step up that adds form creation, OCR features, conversion to/from PDF from lots of document formats, and adds a version of Dragon for adding notes to PDF's. It is at it's heart a PDF converter.<br /><br />Installation was completely uneventful. The registration/activation is a bit annoying but it seems the sort of the way the software world is headed. This hasn't always been the case for Nuance products. Paperport in particular was known for installation problems.<br /><br />Like most Nuance products I've used this has a quirkyness to its interface. If you have used other Nuance programs you'll know what I mean. If not you'll either get used to it or become frustrated. I think most people adapt without much trouble.<br /><br />In general I've used the PDF conversion features and some basic form creation so far. I've played a little with the dragon notes and it seems to work pretty well with my voice.<br /><br />The results seem to open on fine on Acrobat Reader XI and Acrobat Pro X..<br /><br />Power PDF installed and worked well. It has a broad set of features. The interface is Nuance &#34;quirky&#34; and the registration/activation is a bit annoying. So I'm giving 4 stars to Power PDF.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone."
3,"I wanted something basic and simple just to use for balancing my checkbook. I didn't want all the online banking stuff.<br />Once I figured out how to bypass all the online features the program is ok. I wish it had an option that it would show you upcoming bills in my startup menu whenever I turn on my desktop. I got spoiled with Microsoft money, wish they still made that software. They could have made this program a bit simpler, but it'll do."
1,"I admit it, I got excited for the new version and upgraded. Nearly all the marketing features hyped above are not ready for prime time. Budgeting is a big fail. I'm going to revert to an excel spreadsheet and manually transfer the values. The numbers are off and there is an odd way of handling categories and future transactions.<br /><br />Mobile sync crashes around 50% of the time and takes roughly 5 minutes to complete, while the software is locked and unusable. I hit sync and walk away. Using the iOS interface took some getting used to, and I may use it \\""on the fly\\"" but it's not as nimble as the Pocket Quicken app in the days of Palm (yes, I'm that old and have been using Quicken that long!)<br /><br />I could go on, but the other reviews hit the high points. I came from 2011 and wish that I could go back, but I've put too much new info in the data file, so I'm stuck.<br /><br />If I could do it all over again, I'd wait to upgrade until users report all the kinks are worked out (if ever). Just head over to the forums and see what people are posting. I wish I did before I purchased. As of today (10/8/12) I have taken a step backward from usage. Thank god for Excel to fill in the holes while other people that purchased this too early \\""beta test\\"" for Intuit.<br /><br />---------------------------------------<br />EDIT 11/15/12: I just downloaded the seventh (R7) update and it completely corrupted my data. Mind you, I had to add a \\""balancer\\"" transaction to a few of my accounts with the upgrade to 2013. Amounts were off, but I couldn't figure out where or why.<br /><br />With R7, I had to restore from a backup (thank God I backup). If I could downgrade this review to zero stars I would. I no longer attempt to use the budgeting feature, we use excel and manually patch the data back into Quicken. I have mobile completely disabled (it added corrupt data). I bought a book to understand some of the \\""new features,\\"" if only to find a workaround.<br /><br />If I could go back to my previous version or if there was a reasonable competitor I would abandon this product immediately.<br /><br />--------------<br />EDIT 3/2/2013<br />--------------<br /><br />We're on R11 (patch 11) now. I'm happy to report that I haven't had any data corruptions recently--for a couple of months. The mobile/iOS experience is still not working. Now every time I try to use it recently I get a \\""Data Error\\"" and it boots me completely out. That is to say it requires that I go back an re-enter my UN and PW as opposed to simply the iOS program PIN. Then it simply gives the same error and requires a sign out. I may delete the account and create a new one, again, to see if that fixes it as it has in the past. As you can gather from my review above and other users, it hasn't been sufficiently reliable for me to consistently use it, so I can't say it's a huge loss for me. However, if you view it as a big selling point, don't purchase this software for this feature.<br /><br />There are many bugs that are still not worked out (again, venture over to Quicken's support forum). My view on the software is still the same. This is not an adequately vetted program and is still not ready for public release. If you MUST upgrade for some reason, such as banking compatibility, it's tolerable--at least you won't lose data (well, maybe). I still backup frequently. The only reason I'd say that's a remotely acceptable option is because there are no real competitors here. My rating stands at 1 of 5 stars."
5,Perfect for my home office needs and easy to install with the key card!
1,"Form Setup does not work in Peachtree Complete Accounting 7.0. Peachtree makes it easy to choose the data you would like to appear on your forms, however, under many criteria categories either no data or incorrect data is pulled. I chose &quot;description for sales&quot; and it worked for a while but then started drawing from &quot;description for purchases&quot; (tech support was able to duplicate this). When I asked for &quot;short description&quot; I got &quot;description for purchases&quot;, &quot;description for sales&quot;, &quot;short description&quot;, or nothing at all depending on the form I was printing. Peachtree told me it is a design problem that was present in 6.0 and will be present in the next version, 8.0. Bernard from tech support told me that the following version may work properly but that he was &quot;not at liberty to discuss&quot; when that might be. I am returning my software because Peachtree seems in no hurry to fix design problems."
1,"It works but is so limiting it is annoying. You can not reconcile, write checks etc. This was possible with version 3 for DOS now no more.<br />If you are a long time Mac user you wonder why there is NOT one good product out there for financial management and check writing."
5,The product is fine. I already had McAffee protection on my old computers so this was not a big decision.
2,"Got Windows 7, so bought this version BUT all my years of work on Print Shop Deluxe 2.0 on my Windows XP are for nothing...you cant import old files. What a disappointing program. Does anyone out there know how to contact Broderbund to complain. They have no customer relations site!!"
5,"This is a powerful and fun program to get you catapulted into the animation video field. Lots of bells and whistles and a variety of character elements to choose from. Still, I feel it requires a long, difficult learning curve to get into fine-tuning the effects, but the results are excellent. With the built in figures and adjustable movements, you can quickly learn to post your first animated cartoon. I have tried this with videos posted to YouTube. The only drawback is that it does take some time to handle the many movements and timelines. Well designed and engineered - now I have to practice, practice, practice. Good price; good product."
1,Waste of money if you have 529 plan. This software can not handle 1098-T and 1099-Q forms.
3,"Hi! I loaded this product and when attempting to load state the software asked for an ADDITIONAL $34.95. When I contacted TurboTax on-line they first told me it was not yet available, then said \\""All 2006 and 2007 TurboTax Federal Packages include state.\\"" We will see. I have a sneaking suspicion I've been had."
5,"As an editor for a children's book publishing company, I wondered if mastering the keyboard would encourage my nine-year-old daughter to write. She absolutely loved the program, and knowing where to find the letters on the keyboard has made such a difference. Now she begs for computer time so she can type her own original stories and poems! Imagine a third grader enjoying creative writing instead of silly computer games! I'm sure this will give her an advantage in the upper grades when she has to type assignments and reports. Highly recommended."
5,"5 installs for cheap. Can't beat this. No downloads necessary. After using the rest, this takes 1-2 minutes without downloading anything."
2,Does not let me print out any types of business cards or photo projects only will allow with regular papers whats the point???
5,"It re-partitioned my C drive with no problems when it was almost full with a bad sector or block on the drive. I also had drive I was having difficulty formating but director 10.0 did the job, a must have utility program. There is a learning curve with this program if you want to get into all its aspects but its not very steep."
1,"I installed this today and after a few hours, tons of searching for a solution online, and plenty of messing with my computer settings, I am throwing the towel in. I continually get an error message that the &#34;Sound Level is Too Low&#34; and I cannot even get past the profile setup wizard due to this error. The headphones included with the software are either junk, or the software itself has an error with Windows 7. A user forum I was reading mentioned that if you call Nuance with this problem they will spend plenty of time making sure you checked all the obvious solutions, then they apologize and tell you they have a software glitch they are working on. I haven't subjected myself to this process, and I don't plan on it, either. No product should require this much work just to get it to function adequately.<br /><br />Well, a glitch working with Windows 7 is a big deal. I am computer savvy, I can build a PC from parts, I can install software, I can change system settings in Control Panel, and I can troubleshoot simple problems better than most computer users. I checked every single listed solution I was able to try, and I simply cannot get this software to run properly. If this is a known bug, as it seems to be, then this product should not be sold as compliant with Windows 7. I am returning this, there is no way I plan on spending even more time and effort getting this to work. I checked the microphone function with the Windows Sound Recorder, and while it is a bit low, it records just fine. So, either the issue is the included headset (hopefully Nuance is not hair-brained enough to send out a faulty headset that will make their software look like garbage) -or- the problem is that their software is buggy and doesn't run properly on my new, clean, non-buggy computer."
5,"This anti virus it is a good choice to protect your computer, quick , light , is an excellent product to a nice price. The Seller was efficient"
5,"although I was expecting a disk, when I received a swipe card to download I was just a little bit annoyed. However I downloaded the card. Once I was able to resolve the issue of find where the code was to be placed, it was all downhill from there. Yes, I recommend, but only if you have patience."
5,I buy this every year to do my taxes. Makes doing taxes easy and takes you right through everything. I would recommend this product.
5,"I loved this product. It's a paint/photo program, not a drawing program. Adobe Photoshop (AP) is a paint/photo program; Adobe Illustrator (AI) is a drawing program. AP creates bitmap files, and AI create vector files. Bitmap files are images made up of little dots. Whereas vector files are mathematical formulas that are easily scaleable. The native files for Sketchbook are stored in layered TIF format, but they can be exported in many different bitmap file formats: gif, jpeg, and PSD.<br /><br />I have used quite a number of different kinds of computer applications over the years: wordprocessing, spreadsheet, presentations, database, email, WYSIWYG Web page designers, paint/photo, and drawing. Of all these different types of computer programs I have had the most difficulty learning to use well the paint/photo kind. This is probably because I am not really an artist - at least not one adept at creating visual pictures using my hands. I am much better at taking photos with a digital camera and tweeking them using Adobe Photoshop. I have always found AP to be a tough cookie when it comes to creating original artwork from scratch.<br /><br />Sketchbook Pro makes it much easier for me to create original artwork from scratch. It is designed to be used with a digital pen tablet. The intuitive user interface is slick and pleasing to eye, and you will be up and running in no time using pencils, brushes, layering, and pan/zoom features. This product is going to make it easy for you to \\""sketch\\"" out a rough draft of the artwork you want to create. It will not create a masterpiece probably, but you can certainly move your file into AP and tweek your art to your heart's content.<br /><br />This product was easy for me to install, and it has never appeared sluggish to me when using it. I suppose the only problem I had with the product is its name. I think of the word \\""sketch\\"" as being a drawing. Thus at first I thought this was a drawing program. So don't be confused by the name. What you will get with this product is an easy to use somewhat powerful paint/photo program that will help turn you into a pretty good digital artist if you are not already one. And if you are already expert I suspect you will thoroughly enjoy this product to create the early-goings of a paint file you will fine tune in AP. 5 stars!this product is an easy to use somewhat powerful paint/photo program that will help turn you into a pretty good digital artist if you are not already one. And if you are already expert I suspect you will thoroughly enjoy this product to create the early-goings of a paint file you will fine tune in AP. 5 stars!"

5,"Using the Macbook 15in. with Parallels 8. It works so well that when I am developing on the Windows 8 side using Visual Studio 12, there is no difference at all between running native vs as a virtual machine. I can switch back and forth between OSX and Windows 8 fluidly. I even use things like Snagit on the Mac and use that to do videos and screen shots of the windows side. Wonderful integration."
1,"Retrospect is a terrible software application for the ordinary Mac or Windows user. Both versions are complex and difficult to use, and the interfaces are extremely unintuitive. To make matters worse, EMC will want to charge you $69 if you need help with this indecipherable mess. I only hope that the Time Machine backup feature that debuts with Mac's Leopard version of OS X will finally put this product out of business."
4,"Mac OS 10.1, the long-awaited gift from Apple, is impressively stable. The stability of this OS gives it an edge over the older build of Mac OS 9 (and older systems). Dynamic memory allocation and preemptive multitasking are positive aspects too.<br />However, I would not suggest OS X on a G3 unless you are ready for slow resizing and tediously long launch times.<br />Indeed, even though it is slower, I feel that I am obliged to use OS X on my 600 MHz iBook - not because Apple is phasing out &quot;classic&quot; support. The only thing that truly binds me to OS X is that it is much more stable than OS 9. However, seeing how good things are coming with the new ideas from Apple as they update the system, I would suggest keeping an eye open. Perhaps OS X will speed up soon."

5,"The item that I purchased was in excellent condition, and the sell did a great job as far as sending it to me on time. I am very happy with my purchase form her, and give her a thumbs up, you did a great job. The item was what I expected, and in new like condition, I would buy this way again."
1,"We have several copies of this installed in our office. There are about 12 licenses installed on various machines. Over time, as machines break down and get replaced you lose a license for each one. You could deactivate the license to free it up, but this is impossible if the machine won't boot or you take it apart before remembering to deactivate. To make matters worse, we have no idea which keys are install on which machines. I guess Abode expects you to track this, but I can't figure out how to retrieve the installed keys. This is a business, I don't know what the guy before me did. So, now we get to call Adobe everytime we need to use one of our licenses and they do not have the greatest support team. This has cost us plenty in productivity and the product isn't cheap to begin with. If you can avoid using this product I would recommend doing so."
5,"I was very reluctant to buy this. It didn't even look legitimate at first, but rest assured, it's all good. I even had to contact Microsoft support for a small glitch and they remotely controlled my pc and fixed the issue - for free. Windows 8, and since I've updated to 8.1, is far superior to Vista. I have Windows 7 on another computer and really like it too, but Windows 8 is so much more stable and fast compared to Vista it's not funny. Just be aware that you will need to re-install many if not all programs after the upgrade. There is a free Windows 8 &#34;are you ready for Windows 8&#34; download you can get for free before you buy. Best software purchase I've made in years."
5,I really love this anti virus protection.....I never had a problem with it and it protects just as good if not better than norton.....but this doesnt slow ur computer down like norton and i ownly got a bad virus once cuz any anti virus isnt going to protect ur computer from all.....but still this one is great i recommend it!

2,"The box came with absolutely no directions which is frustrating. I had to google directions and even then they did not make sense. I could not figure out which computer to put the disc into and how to run it as a DVD. It was not made clear that I needed a firewire. There are lots of options and no concrete explanations. Finally, my files were recovered in text edit form and code. In total I spent almost $150 for the software and cord for my files to be in a form that I did not create it in. I now have to spend extra time and money to recover the files to their original form. However, I spent $40 for my mac at a computer store that recovered everything in the original form and even in the folders I had originally placed them in."
5,This is a great product I am very happy with it. It works great on my computer never had a problem with it at all. :0)
2,"I was very disappointed when I tried to reinstall my software into my new computer, my installation code said it was invalid. My copy is authentic and purchased at Costco. Intuit wont help unless I purchase their support plan. Intuit should at least help with this as it also helps them control piracy. Microsoft has no problem with this and either does any other software mfg I have ever seen. I think Intuit needs to get off their high horse and learn how to treat their customers. Any business with attitude toward their customers is replaceable in my opinion. I won't forget..."
4,This is a great software for my digital camera. If I take a not so great pic I can go to the photo enhancer and enhance it to a better pic. I have never used any other photo software so I have nothing to compare it to but I think it is great.
5,"The nero 2015 premium is excellent software. Requierment of sistem is high, but the perfomance is very very well.<br />I recomend."
3,"I bought this software for myself (learning keyboard) but I also have children. The software focuses on learning how to read music and also locating the notes on the keyboard. It would be helpful for children/adults playing any instrument. Most of the lessons are based on learning the notes on the scale, counting beats, etc. Cons: The doodle pad composer does not save on my computer (I have vista) so when my son makes his \\""masterpieces\\"" I can not save them to listen to later. Also the graphics are very dated. There doesn't seem to be any competition for this type of software so I guess that is why it hasn't been updated. Overall I think this is a good game and slightly overpriced ( I paid 45 on here but feel 30 would have been a better price since the game is older) I have finished all of the lessons but go back and do the games to improve my speed with identifying notes on the scale and the keyboard."
5,"I don't believe this is for sale anymore on Amazon (although you can buy from DietPower directly) however I first discovered this software by looking on Amazon. I'm so happy I did! I started a \\""diet\\"" a month before I discovered this and was putting in a lot of exercise and moderately watching what I ate but not getting great results. I had lost a couple pounds but nothing near where I should have been for as much hard work as I was putting into exercise and strength training. I went to the DietPower website and downloaded a two week trial version for free. In those two weeks I lost five pounds simply because I had visibility to the calories I was taking in and what I was burning off through exercise. The software itself is rather complex but it is very simple to use. Logging foods and exercise is very easy and quick. It even helps you track your water intake based on demands from food and exercise. It helps track the nutrition in what you are eating so you have visibility to how much vitamins you intake and where you might be lacking throughout the day. This is great software. I would highly encourage anyone, even those maintaining weight, to go grab a trial version of this and try it out. This software has shown me that I can eat well and still achieve results."
4,"There are few differences between Office 2010 and Office 365. I suppose the services offered are ok for those who will use them but for my purposes, Office 2010 would be my choice."
2,"I purchased this because I liked the idea of having an encyclopedia set without taking up the space. When I recieved the software I did a full install, got to the screen offering the trial for Britanica Online and felt dooped. The software is extremely basic, for further information they want you to purchase the online access. This may be good software for elementary kids research for school, or general information browsing but definitely not for info junkies. The navigation of info and articles is strange, the atlas is very basic maps, the search function and results are cluttered and frustrating. There are very few user preferences that you can change. Overall I don't feel it was worth the $22 I paid for it. I would maybe purchase as a gift for someone without internet access, other than that I would pass. Would happily build shelves for a whole set instead."
5,Windows XP is definitley the best and most advanced of any operating system for a personal computer. It's programs are amazing. If one has a PC the only operating system they should even think about getting is XP. XP is the standard. Everything runs on XP. This is the best technology yet and I love Windows XP
1,"Norton doesn't work and you will be expected to pay $99 to get Customer Support when the program fails. I am very computer literate and relied on Norton to protect my computer from viruses and malware. I am quite competent at avoiding threats, but there are some that even the most experienced user can't prevent. Their program did not catch an old \\""virus\\"" (technically malware) that has been out for a long time, so it wasn't an unavoidable problem.<br /><br />When I contacted customer support for help removing the program Norton didn't catch, they tried to charge me $99 to correct their mistake before they would even discuss the problem (either do it yourself or pay $99). I spent over 4 hours working with inexperienced techs that did not have adequate computer knowledge trying to get the problem fixed. The \\""Customer Service\\"" agent deleted at least one unrelated program from my computer (was not infected) that I will have to pay to replace. I will now have to spend my time trying to figure out how to totally remove the malware from my computer as it seems to be in the registry and affecting my computer after Norton's software claimed it was quarantined (it took 4 hours and 3 techs to even get that far on top of the multiple scans I had run). I will likely have to pay someone to work on my computer to ensure that my computer is safe and pay for new antivirus software. My computer is nearly unusable.<br /><br />Bottom line, Windows 7 has great antivirus software built in (you do have to find it and turn it on) or you can use a number of free options that work as well or better than Norton. It has been years since I've tried Mcafee so I can't comment on it's effectiveness. Do not depend on Norton even if you are computer literate. If you aren't knowledgeable about the latest threats or if other family members that aren't use it, you DEFINITELY don't want to rely on Norton."
2,"Very dissapointed in TurboTax this year. Have used TT for 20 years or so, but next year will likely switch to a competitor. Things taken out of Deluxe and not told until after bought it. Felt like was &#34;bait and switched&#34;. Offered $25, but having to get Premiere cost me $30. Costs for personal plus a LLC business are now approaching $150 per year - way to much. Used to be reasonable for TT to do taxes. Too bad..."

5,"Going back to school after 23 years was really terrifying. I had never heard of APA guidlines and format. When I looked at the APA guide book provided by the college, I had a full blown panic attack. First ever! APA just did not make since. PERRLA was recommended by three coworkers who had receintly graduated from college. PERRLA is amazing. I have completed my first semester without even one APA error. It makes paper writing a breeze. Step by step instruction for every paper. PERRLA saves all citations so previously used sources do not have to be re-cited. Saves hours of time for each paper. I had one technical difficulty (My own error). I emailed PERRLA support and recieved a reply with step by step instruction the same afternoon AND on a WEEKEND! The support response was easy to understand and solved my problem instantly. It was written as if the person was speaking directly to me. Contact numbers were provided as well. PERRLA has taken the stress out of paper writing. Love it! Old Dog With New Tricks! Candy Rutledge RN"
1,We had this game before and it worked just fine until the disk got damaged. We ordered this replacement and it wouldn't even install right. Contacted the company and they were useless. Managed to get it installed and then tried to start the game and we get a blank error message every time - how do you fix that??? VERY frustrating. What a waste of money! We were unable to return it because we live overseas. We have had similar trouble with other Carmen Sandiego games. Never again.
3,"This works as well as a Microsoft product can,which means it's clumsy to use. Unfortunately most of the world uses this crap."
5,"Funny how the bad reviews are all about not being able to play a 19 year old game on mostly current machines. For those of you who still have the disk, YES, you can still play it in Windows 7, 64-bit. The game is awesome, someone else wrote a major review of it, read his summary for all the details. This is a very enjoyable game, as is its sequel Starsiege."
5,"Used Turbo Tax in the past, Got too expensive and this is easier for me to use"
5,Let me start by saying I am 24 years old and still love this game. I was happy to see that not a whole lot has changed since the 1998 version and that what is different is neat.This big kid loves it!
5,"I got this program for free with my Visor Edge, and although it was a great freebie the Edge already came with a datebook the was equally as good as this one. Still for the time I had it, it worked great and didn't give me any problems while transfering my addresses and other pieces of data from my computer to my handheld. So I recomend this to someone who has an old PDA that doesn't have a great datebook."
5,Great tool for someone who is visually impaired. What a great idea for me to get for myself. I love it
5,"I love the new features on Photoshop Elements 9 without having to buy the full CS5 Photoshop program they included just enough from CS5 program to make it a wonderful program which is more than the average person would ever need. I am familiar with Photoshop programs but I am still in the learning process I think it would take a while to become a pro at it but with Elements 9 they give you three settings to help you which are full, Quick and Guided. They don't give you a manual but there is all sorts information with tips and trick and how to's on the internet and also several books one I thought was good was Photoshop Elements 9 For Dummies their books are explain real well plus on their site- [...] they give you how to pages to copy. If you want a real Photo editor program one that will grow with you once you have learn the basic then this is the program to get but if you looking for something that will do all the work for you and you are happy with the results from auto everything then don't get this program stick with the Windows base Photo program. One more note they give you two CD one for Mac and one for Windows."
5,I enjoy making projects using this software. It's intuitive to use and the finished products look professional.
5,Having the Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe 2007]card program enabless me to be able to print a card when I need one instead of going to the store to pick just the right card
4,"Both variety and quality of the images are excellent, and the Export Wizard makes it very easy to use them. The search engine, however, can only be described as &quot;primitive,&quot; and you will need time and patience to find what you're looking for. I used the keyword &quot;girl&quot; as a test and got both appropriate images and others that left me scratching my head - many pics of soldiers in battle among them. As I scroll through search results, I've taken to copying good, but unrelated, images to a document in case I can't find them again! Overall, very good but could be great with a better search engine."
1,"Intuit has indeed corrected the problems with the Mac updates!! UNFORTUNATELY, it took them so long that I was forced to wait over 5 WEEKS!! Although they were able to fix this mess with those machines still running OS 8.1/8.5, I WILL NO LONGER PURCHASE TURBOTAX. I can't tell you how MANY hours were wasted downloading files that would not install on a Macintosh with 0S 8.5.1. I will give Tax Cut a try next year."
4,"I have been playing around with making videos on this and it isn't as intuative as I thought it would be. I really think this is a good product, has a lot of editing options, just not easy to learn to use. I wasn't impressed with the minimal amount of instructions/guides that came with it. I will have to download the full user guide and try and play around some more. it was easy to install and I have made a few videos, but can't wait to find time to learn more about the editing features."
5,"Great. Cost effective. Keep this secret, that when you install it goes online to get the latest Mcafee product and you still get to use this 2 year old license. It is good for the ecology not to throw out leftovers if they still work as good as the expensive latest release."
5,My child loved this cd program. He can't get enough of it.
4,"This software works as expected. My computer has the 64 bit processor; so I didn't have the problem other older Mac computer owners complained about... I agree, they should have some type of very obvious warning about needing the latest processors to use this software. My only complaint is... too many questions about things that didn't apply to me and stop trying to sell me stuff in the middle of trying to get through the worst part of my year !"
2,"My problems began with installation. <br /> <br />1.) File was corrupted upon loading the software from the CD. Went to ACT website, they had the file available (not a unique problem, obviously), and I was then able to load. <br /> <br />2.) I then had problems converting data from ACT! 6.0. Went to ACT website again, only solution was to uninstall and reinstall. I also shut down Spybot, which may have corrupted the first loading. They tell you to shut down Anti-Virus software, which I did, but not Spybot. Data converted after doing this. <br /> <br />3.) I have NO custom fields, but data from my Salutation field did not convert. All fields blank. Since I had converted to ACT! 6.0 from a previous customer manager, this meant I lost all my contact first names, and this was the deal-breaker. I may have been able to get through this, but see 4.). <br /> <br />4.) I did not notice item three for several hours, and used the program during that time. As previous reviewers have noted, it is noticably slower than ACT! 6.0. It also slows down the rest of one's computer, reboot is slower, etc. I also started having problems with MS Outlook crashing, which had never happened before. <br /> <br />All things considered, I decided to return the software, and stick with ACT! 6.0, at least for a year or so while they figure things out. ACT chose to go with a more complex platform, which may help them with their corporate accounts, but is more problematic for smaller users. Computer speed will continue to be an issue. Also, you cannot synch with other users with Windows XP any longer. You must upgrade to Windows Professional. <br /> <br />I found ACT! (Best Software) to be good about trying to make things work, and allowing me to return the software. Their support group surpasses their product development group. If you are dying to try ACT! 2005, either wait a few months while they fix a few things, or be prepared for a tedious conversion process and slowerperformance. Buy from Amazon or Best Software or a reputable vendor directly, so you can return the software if necessary. <br /> <br />"

3,"(...)<br />What I as an (Oracle) server user don't like about RedHat is the missing Oracle support (of course it will work; but compare with SuSE (...) and also Oracle uses SuSE for their Linux development now, they switched away from RedHat), and some server features like the Logical Volume Manager was long missing and is still much better supported by SuSE. So yes, independently RedHat deserves a great review, but in comparison with SuSE it's only #2, that's the reason why I subtracted some points."
3,"I was surprised to see that NTI Backup Now 5.5 advanced has such low ratings, so I came here to read the reviews. I see two different 1 star reviews from people who say nothing about its backup/restore performance, and instead complain about their installation issues.<br /><br />I am no expert in this area. All I can say is that I chose NTI 5.5 Advanced because I needed a program that wouldn't balk at backing up OPEN FILES. And so far, 5.5 seems to be doing that just fine. So far I have not had a need to restore any backups, so I am reluctant to give this product my full endorsement until I've seen whether it restores properly. So I'm going to give it three stars for now.<br /><br />But come on people, just because you're having install issues, don't automatically assume its NTI's fault. My install went smooth as silk and I've been using the product for many months with massive (50+ gig) automatic backups every night. I've tried a few similar products. This one seems to be pretty easy to use for an average Joe. And it does backup open files."
2,"I have not been pleased with this company. I tried to order it the other day, and the program couldn't install on my Windows 7 computer. I have no idea why... and am not computer savy enough to deal with it. When I tried to get a refund, they took a long time to write back to me. Poor customer service, and very slow. Maybe it does work with Windows 7, but I don't believe it."
1,"Still will not work. Went through many training sessions which I completed but had to talk slower than normal. It then locks up and won't let me use it. Contacted technical support and they just want more money to help with it. I am just now installing and Dragon wants to charge to get it to work. Glad I didn't buy a car from them, they would ask if I expected to go somewhere in it. Well, it costs extra if you want it to work."
5,"This program is wonderful for so many different processes.<br />If you work with pdf files or want to learn how to this is the program<br />for you. Have wished to have this for several years. I'm glad I<br />waited for this version. It is smooth and if you have a working knowledge of<br />previous versions of Professional, you will appreciate the upgraded performance."
3,"In this review, I consider 3 points<br /><br />1) organization and difficulty of the material<br />2) interface<br />3) software vs book (M. Block \\""The art of combination in chess\\"")<br /><br />1) The soft is marketed to players with elo up to 2300. At the same time, the material is classified according to tactical and geometric motives. This has both pros and cons, and IMHO suits better to beginners and lower itermediates rather than to more advanced intermediates and experts. A book cannot be organized both ways; a software certainly makes it possible, but no such feature (e.g. @show a random position with a difficulty between 50 to 120) exists in CT-ART (even in the test mode, the topic is still shown in the upper bar).<br /><br />The difficulty varies dramatically throughout the course. Comparing with well known Konotop series of tests in chess tactics, difficulty level of 10 should belong to \\""test for beginners\\"" (ca 800-1200 elo), while problems with difficulty above 110 would probably be found in \\""tests for candidate masters\\"" (2000 FIDE Elo and above).<br /><br />2) interface: fair to poor. First of all, if you have windows Vista you need to know a thing or two about the interactions of this soft with your OS. Convecta recommends turning the UCA off, which is plain ridiculous, because ct-art also works fine (if it ever works fine) when you install it in a separate folder outside your \\""program files\\"" folder. Secondly, I never succeeded in making the pieces move faster and the intervals shorter (the pieces move extremely slow. If the problem is easy I nearly fall asleep). Theoretically you can control the speed and the interval, but in practice the soft doesnt respond: thisngs move the same slow way whatever speed you set. If you make a mistake, the program displays a refutation if it typed in. Otherwise, it shows a \\""prompt\\"" using ridiculous blinking markers. I had to quit the excersise and restart it each time I made a mistake. You CAN turn them off though, this option does work.<br /><br />3) CT-ART vs Bloch's book. What is good in CT-ART? The very selection of the problems. I do find it excellent, it teaches precision and consideration of all tactical motives in each position. But: here the soft and the book are nearly identical. What is bad in CT-ART? Basically, everything else. Poor interface. ridiculous ratings that have nothing to do with the reality. In many positions there are several ways to win, but the program gives you a penalty (tipically, the first move is unique, but on later stages.... Once I got a penalty for correctly executed checkmate in one!). On the other hand, when solving a difficult problem (90+) I happened to fail to find the principle ideas, but still collect 60% of points for that problem! Conclusion: I quit the soft and got the book.<br /><br />UDP: Now CT-ART is already available with the new Peshk@ interface. As far as I was told, the interface issues have been resolved.<br /><br />Hope this hepls.<br />AVoption does work.<br /><br />3) CT-ART vs Bloch's book. What is good in CT-ART?

2,"Ditto to everything &quot;arryman&quot; said below. I am an Art Director and I recently upgraded from version 3. The older versions were built extremely well and I liked Dreamweaver, because it was one of the few WYSIWIG web design tools that did not &quot;mess up my code.&quot; This new version runs very, very slowly, inserts code in &quot;wrong&quot; places, adds redundant and unneeded tags and crashes in the middle of doing all that! I like the interface and obviously the support for CSS, but I've been finding myself hand-coding in &quot;Code&quot; mode, and not really taking advantage of the WYSIWIG tools."
1,"I had thought that Microsoft might have been the creme of the crop, but it seems that it's just that: a myth. This software feels very empty, counterintuitive, and hard to use. The \\""points of interest\\"" lack plenty of places that I needed to find during my travels. The address search is pitiful, and I just could not think of a good reason of why I bought this.

4,Intuitive user interface makes creation less frustrating than with some other programs I have used. Both audio and video are easy to manipulate for creation. Broad range of input/output options. Solid piece of software. I continue to be pleased by Corel products.

I have been in contact with a Mr. &quot;Lee Thornton&quot; &lt;Surreal1@mediaone.net&gt; who assures me that it will in fact make an EXE file as well as build apps that will self-install (Setup). I found Mr. Browns review very confusing.

1,"Last year Quicken Home and Business made a $12,000 error in the balance reports for my tax return. We found this error ourselves during an audit. When we requested a fix from Intuit, the reponse from The Office of the President at Intuit was, \\""Sure it's a bug, but Quicken is sold AS IS with NO WARRANTY. We don't guarantee that our software does anything at all, so we're under no obligation to do anything to help you.

5,"I was looking for a back up program that would work with Windows XP Home. I did my homework by searching and checking out all the available back up programs on the internet. I also checked to see if my RW and CD and ScanDisk drivers were listed in the compatable drive section of their website. After having downloaded a trial copy from Stomp website I found that it worked perfectly with my computer and system. I then ordered the software from Amazon.com and it works just great. No trouble downloading and preforming a complete back up of my hard drive. I backed up 11.3 GB in 4 hrs. and 30 minutes which took 17 cd's for the 87,393 files.

1,"I've been a Quicken user for nearly 20 years, and have loved it. However, this Quicken Essentials for Mac program is the WORST.

1,"In short: Snow Leopard (SL) feels like a Beta release. It is NOT ready for prime-time. This honestly feels like the release of Microsoft Me (Millenium edition, remember when MS put out that garbage as an \\""upgrade\\"" to '98?). SL is THAT bad. Details: With every update to OS X you hear the stories of third-party apps not being compatible and causing issues. Understandable, given the limitations of some (especially smaller) developers. In my case, the apps in question are Apple's own Mail and iTunes. Specifically, Mail would lock while trying to download new mail. The update circle/arrow next to each email address would spin all day. Meanwhile, the same mail came through just fine on my wife's MacBook Pro (running 10.5.8). iTunes would at some point (while sitting idle all day while I'm off at work) inform me that my iTunes library could not be found and the pop-up error messages (one for each of the thousands of items in my iTunes library) could not be Force Quit. After rebooting, everything would work fine for a while. This is why I switched to a Mac. To avoid this exact issue (rebooting multiple times a day just to do the basics). I upgraded my iMac (just over a year old, Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4) to SL on 9/3 and gave it a week to sort out any issues. Last night I threw in the towel and reverted back to Leopard (this is why you MUST create a cloned copy of your hard drive before you upgrade (use Super Duper or Carbon Copy Cloner and create a bootable drive (and test it! (hold down the Option key while you reboot)) before you do any OS upgrade (PC or Mac))). Time Machine couldn't save me. It told me I was out of disk space (I wasn't). I know all the great features Apple put into SL (which I why I upgraded so early in the life-cycle) and was loving them (smart disk eject, click and hold on an app in the Dock and see all the occurences of that app, super fast boot times, etc). But until the bugs get fixed, I don't dare go near Microsoft Me - sorry,I meant Snow Leopard - again. Apple, shame on you for putting out this garbage as a gold master. You were a month ahead of schedule and still rushed the QA. And it shows. No longer will I be able to say \\""get a Mac, it just works\\"". I've put many friends into Macs over the years. Now I just can't recommend them without a huge caveat. Not until Apple makes this right. Well, Apple... we're waiting...."
1,"I spent several years with the predecessor to this program only to have my database totally corrupted with no fix. Even when it works, it is painfully slow and crashes frequently. I tried the new version since I now have Vista. It is no better. Although it promises to work with Outlook, it apparently doesn't work with Microsoft Outlook Exchange. Every time I try to sync it just crashes. There is no customer support unless you are willing to pay their ridiculous prices. I've got seven years of data in there but I am ready to abandon it and re-enter the data in another program. Stay away. Intuit should be ashamed of themselves."

5,"I would like to have known before I bought it that that I could put it on my 2 computers and if I got a new computer that it would sooner or later I would have my installs gone I thought when you bought the game that you would be able to install it on both your computers and if you bought a new one it would work on that one to? We love the games on the disk, but we don't have a lot of money so if the 2 installs more that they gave me run out we are just done cant afford to pay twice for one that we have already have. I have bought it again I tried to get my mystery code but no matter what I do it won't give it to me PLEASE HOW CAN I GET THE CODE I PD. FOR !!!!!!!!"
5,I am very satified with the Windows Live OneCare software. It works well on my computer. It was shipped immediately and I recieved it in record time.
5,Yes it did. My computer runs faster better and their's a lot of apps. to choose from. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a upgrade.
5,It works well
1,"The CD version I received was uninstallable. Not due to a bad CD, but due to Sierra installation package that does not have the correct file names. If buying this product be prepared to have to return it to Sierra ( at additional cost ) and wait for a replacement. I am still waiting for a replacement, so have no idea of how long the wait is going to be or whether the replacement CD will work any better than the original. The CD came with 3 Demo programs also, of which one had the same problem as 'Contraptions'. I.e. incorrect file names in the installation package. I would not recommend any Sierra product based on experience and lack of support from Sierra."
5,there were no glitches in the program and updates went smoothly. The interview is easy to understand The price is lower than the competition I wish they renamed it 'Taxcut' because 'HR Block at home' is so non-descript
5,good
5,"I have a general working knowledge of several languages - studied in high school and college and through living and working in various countries - but have never formally studied French and knew very little of it. I've been looking for years for a suitable program for it but have always shied away from the \\""total immersion\\"" approach of Rosetta Stone. From my, albeit limited, exposure to Rosetta, it seems that their lessons leave too many unsolved questions about what's going on. To follow them, you'd really need to equip yourself with a grammar book and dictionary and be prepared to dig for lots of explanations the lessons don't supply.<br /><br />The theory behind an immersion program seems to be that little children learn languages much better than adults, so we should try to mimic that experience with adults. The trouble is that adults don't learn as little children do - and as the Fluenz creators recognize, that's both a plus and a minus. It's a disadvantage in that adults will most likely never master a language quite as deeply as a child. An English-speaking adult who learns French, for example,will never be able to speak French without at least a trace of an English accent. But having learned English thoroughly before learning French is also a huge advantage! English speaking adults can leverage their existing knowledge of how a language (English) works to learn the target language. As adult English speakers, we already understand the many forms we need a verb to take: for I, you, s/he, we, they. So when we learn the \\""I\\"" form, we look for the \\""he\\"" form and etc. Because of the knowledge we have of what we don't know, we make much more rapid progress in the target language than a child could.<br /><br />But. We can do so only if we are given explanations that correspond to the questions we naturally have. For a simple example: we naturally wonder, why do you say you are going \\""en France\\"" but \\""a Paris\\""? It's unnecessarily frustrating if the language program youuse never bothers to provide you with the simple explanation that you always use \\""a\\"" when you are going to a city but not necessarily to a country.<br /><br />Each Fluenz lesson begins with a short intro, then goes to a dialogue which provides information and vocabulary relevant to tourists. Each lesson develops and expands upon the grammar introduced in the previous lessons. Because most people traveling to Francophone countries will be interested in getting the basics down, lessons often center on being in a cafe and ordering food, or with traveling from place to place or asking questions at a hotel. These short dialogues can be listened to with no subtitles, with subtitles only in French, and with subtitles in English and French. After the student has listened to the dialogue, the instructor comes on and goes through what the student has just heard, line by line, adding additional relevant information as well as mnemonic devices to help students retain the information. The instructor also adds related concepts or structures to those introduced in the dialogue. Subsequent \\""workouts\\"" encourage students to practice through reading, writing, listening and speaking. What I find particularly delightful are the little comments the instructor sprinkles in along the way about some element from film or sports or culture. Once, the instructor mentioned that the bidet was \\""one of France's great gifts to womankind.\\"" I doubt I'll ever forget that line as it was so unexpected and human a remark.<br /><br />As much as I love this program, I would have given it 4.75 stars rather than 5 if that were possible because the software is just a bit glitchy. You have to play around with it in order to get it to work properly. For example, you might, in a given workout, get just one question and find, when you hit \\""next\\"" that the workout seems to be done. There is no way to move forward within it. What you need to do in that case is select \\""next workout\\"" and then go back - and backwards -until you complete the previous workout. It took a while for me to realize this, so I missed some valuable practice along the way.<br /><br />Overall, Fluenz is an excellent program, long overdue. I look forward to learning my next language with Fluenz."

3,This product so far has worked well and I might buy it again next year. I have purchased this product for the last 5 or 6 years and it has performed as expected.
1,This was a replacement for software my Daughter had a some years ago but was not compatible with her new computer. This did not work on Windows XP as advertised. Big disappointment.

5,"This product is great! I will eventually feel the need for full Photoshop, but this program does everything I need right now. Awesome deal!"
5,i love it.

1,"I have been a TurboTax users for years (cannot remember how many but around 10). When looking for TT Home & Business to buy this year, I stumbled upon these customer reviews. I also learned that I can purchase TurboTax Home & Business from Costco for $65 after their discount and thought about buying it because ultimately, I plan on buying Home & Business anyway. I then continued reading on and found so many arrogant and ridiculous replies from the VP that I decided to look for the H&R Block option as recommended by many here. Then luckily I found a way to purchase H&R Block Premium including one State download for only $14.95 plus tax. I even called H&R Block to confirm that I do not even need their Premium & Business for my specific case which will require Home & Business from TurboTax. By the way, H&R Block Deluxe can be purchased for only $4.95 but will be $9.95 if a State is needed. Just google \\""HR Block Deluxe for $4.95\\"" and find out how to do this. Update: H&R Block Premium I purchased installed fine. Last year's file from TurboTax was imported without any problem."
1,"My small business has been using QB for 15 years. As you know they have a captive audience. This version cost me $750.. in technical support expense to have installed. It simply would not run. Finally, our company file was sent to QB so they could load version 13. Well it's installed and I do not like the changes. Would have been happy to remain on version 2010 but then no tax tables.<br />Like I said captive audience. Intuit is laughing all the way to the bank!!"
5,"This collection consists of actual comic books that have been individually scanned and converted to PDF files. This is one of a number of such collections, all of which were an absolutely amazing value when they were first published, with hundreds of comic books, some dating back to the 1960s, available on a single DVD for one low price. Unfortunately, Marvel Comics refused to continue licensing their content to Git Corp and the collections are no longer available. Today, the DVDs are collector's items, sometimes going for hundreds of dollars. At their original publishing price, this was an incredible deal. At the prices today, when you can even find them, you should definitely think twice.<br /><br />The files are not DRM (Digital Rights Management) protected, so you can copy the PDF files to your computer or laptop, even to your Kindle Fire tablet. You can also create backup DVDs to make sure that your collection always remains accessible. If you view the collections on your computer or laptop, using the Adobe official PDF viewer, everything is fine. If you view the collections on your Kindle Fire tablet, there is a semi-transparent &#34;Marvel&#34; watermark that will show up on every page. I've tried every PDF viewer in the Amazon App Store, including the Adobe PDF app, and they all exhibit this flaw. Once I got used to it, though, it didn't bother me much and it's handy to have a really portable way to read these files.<br /><br />Each file contains one complete comic book, including the front and back covers, all of the advertisements, the letters page, and so on. The files are arranged in two-page spreads, 1100 pixels wide by 850 pixels high. I can reduce these to roughly 75% of full size and still read them. Much below that and the text becomes hard to read and the details are muddy.<br /><br />For the collections that go back to the 60s and 70s, it's both nostalgic and hilarious to read some of the advertisements (Sea Monkeys! X-Ray Specs! Charles Atlas!). The scan quality in those earlier issues is surprisingly good, considering the age of each comic book. These are very readable, in very good condition.<br /><br />This collection begins in 1963 with Tales of Suspense #39 (for 12 cents!) where Iron Man was first introduced. In 1964, in Tales of Suspense #59, Captain America joined Iron Man and the comic title officially became Tales of Suspense featuring Iron Man and Captain America. This continued until 1968, where issue #99 became the final Tales of Suspense issue and each hero subsequently got his own title. The Iron Man title continued through issue 332, in 1996, after which Marvel rebooted the character and restarted the issue numbering. The reboot concluded in 1997 with issue #13, with a second reboot beginning in 1998 and ending in 2004 with issue #89. There was a third reboot in 2005 and the collection concludes with issue #12 of that reboot, in 2006. In addition, the collection contains Annuals 1 through 15, Annuals 1998 through 2001, Giant-Size Iron Man #1 (from 1975), and a detailed Iron Man bio. All told, counting index files, there are 586 files to browse.The scan quality in those earlier issues is surprisingly good, considering the age of each comic book.

3,"I bought this program for my wife who is a choir director and has a degree in music. Me, well all I can play is the radio. I installed it on a home computer for her that does not have an internet connection. Problems. I was unaware that you need an internet connection to run the program once it is installed. The work around was to call tech support and get files from them to complete a multi-step process that took 3 days. Once all that was done I did get it to run and have only done simple things like change pitch and tempo. I will say that tech support guys were very helpful and patient."
2,"Was not as easy to put on, as all the other years. When I called for help, no one spoke english.."
5,"I was hesitant to buy Turbo this year after having left to buy TaxCut last year when Intuit had the arrogance to put spyware into their product and add a disturbing activation process. I had always been a Turbo user but was so incensed at last years shenanigans by Intuit that I switched to TaxCut (and would do so again, should they initiate the same nonsense as they did in 2002). In any case, TaxCut in not even remotely as user friendly or robust as Turbo and given the opportunity to have Turbo as it was in 2001 and prior I have gladly come back. After reading the reviews on Amazon I hesitated, but am glad I gave it a try. The installation (on a Win 98 machine)was flawless (except for a minor glitch of it crashing my system when updating the software the first time). Useability is as good as always, in my opinion, which as I've said is light years ahead of TaxCut. In light of the options available on the market, Turbo is the clear choice (unless you want to suffer with a lesser product like TaxCut -- which I will grudgingly do again if Intuit plays games like they did in 2002!)"
5,"Great price on an awesome OS. When installing on your second and 3rd PC make sure to answer and you call the MS helpline make sure to answer no to installed on multiple PC's and talk to the MS rep, let them know your using the family pack and you should be good to go. I cant say enough good things about Windows 7. Using it on 3 PC's, networking and security is a breeze using home group and related permissions. Can use media center for free OTA DVR recording, and share out recorded TV and family videos for the whole house. I have done a ton of Win7 Installs for friends and family and the great majority of hardware is detected right off the bat. Occasionally you may need to tweak a setting but by far this is the best MS OS to date. Its fun to use and easy to manage and works with alot of software. Pro edition adds Domain logons and XP mode, however most shouldnt need these features and can still use MS Virtual PC or VMware for similar functionality. Media Center is fun to tweak, if you do this with a 15 IR remote you can use your PC isntead of Tivio or other similar PVR/DVR solutions. For most this will save 60-80$ a month on TV costs and when coupled with netflix and Hulu offers up some great programming. We get 60 stations in my city over the air which is more than enough. My kids havent complained one bit and have many new programs they love to watch on PBS and Qubo.<br /><br />Detection of network devices and hardware is a snap. Any Dual core 2Ghz plus machine with 2GB ram runs great, but for the record I have even tested on a 5yr old Latitude D610 with 1.5GB ram and even that system runs fine. Bottom line is this OS is simple enough for a novice and loaded with features for anyone who wants to take advantage of them. Drives a little closer to a Mac but with tons more software applications and flexability. I love runing virtual PC sessions for work and fun and how well it all integrated between Win7 PC's."
2,"Well, I have had this software installed on an old Dell Windows 2000 machine and on a new home-built Win XP machine based on an Intel motherboard for less than a year. I can not say that I have been too happy with the overall performance of this product, but it seems to be working well now that it has the latest patches. By the way, they don't tell you that their version 8 and higher software does not work with Windows 2000. So if you want to run an old Win 2K matchine, don't go for this software unless you can get the last of the Version 7 software - version 7.0.483.000. I had the same negative experiences that the above reviewers had, but again, they are now corrected. My XP machine does run the latest version 8 software and it seems to be working great. My Win 2K machine has to run version 7.0.483.000. and it does OK. Can't really complain about the Win2K machine as it is so slow anyway and is no longer supported by Microsoft anyway. Regarding the reviewers that gave this software a 5 star rating. I find it hard to believe that these are legitimate reviews. I would actually suspect these reviews as being sales pitches from the Zone Alarm folks. I find that this company is a little questionable in how they deal with their customers and their customer service. I have seen them delete negative comments on their software from their user forums. They have never lied (that I am aware of), but I simply felt that they do their best to put a rosey picture on their product. As one reviewer above noted, their Tech Support put the blame on my other programs when ZA practically brought my XP machine to its knees. I also was told to disable my other programs until I found \\""the culprit\\"". Well I didn't do that. I have those programs on my computer because I want them there. Better that ZA should fix their product, which they eventually did. However, they never simply came out and took the blame for a defective product update. I used to love their freefirewall and this was why I decided to try their full service product. Hopefully these bad experiences were just growing pains that ZA is getting past, but they have damaged their reputation by failing to be completely forthcoming with their customers. The unwritten rule of bad publicity: tell the customer about your mistake, take responsibility for your mistake (with a sincere apology) and then take corrective action."
3,"I bought this software for transcribing handwritten documents and interviews (I listened to the interviews and repeated the words into the microphone). Unfortunately, it was almost always faster for me to type because the program makes a LOT of mistakes. My interviews and documents have tons of proper names and uncommon older words in them though, so I think MacSpeech might work better for other kinds of dictations or transcriptions. I also find this program to be extremely buggy. It usually crashes at least once per day, even after I installed the updated version. I used MacSpeech quite a bit because my wrists were getting strain injuries from typing, but I usually just ended up getting really frustrated. Maybe with a lot of effort, I could train MacSpeech to better recognize my voice, but I'm not willing to invest more time than it would take me just to type the transcription in the first place. I admire what this program can do, but I don't think I would buy it again."
5,"I like this game and I'm sorry to hear that a 2nd edition won't be forthcoming. I would like to see them simply change the rating system or find away to make sequels available. Yeah, it glorifies creative ways to dispatch enemies, but many FPS do. They just don't always rate the creativity."
1,"worst software and really worse product I've ever used. Virtually unworkable , slow, prone to locking, up bizarre malfunctions, failure of outside software, (Neat receipts, Firefox) are routine. Loaded with features You will neither want or need. It's also slow so be prepared to look at the spinning blue circle more than you have since 1995."
5,AOK
1,"Installed about a year ago without any problem on Vista certified hardware. It was running ok with one annoying problem - it was constantly loosing the video settings every time I reboot. Then these wave of security patch start to roll in. I only use the PC for watching blu-ray movies and after installing 100+ security patches, the system is so slow that I cannot finish 90 minutes movies without rebooting the operating system. Microsoft eventually did fix the video resetting problem (one of those 100+ patch fixed it), but OS is pretty much useless for doing what it is design to do. Now I have to make a decision to add additional memory to satisfy this memory starving OS (I am currently running with 2 GB) or wipe it clean and install Windows XP."
5,"Said Goodbye to turbotax in 2015. Had no problems installing H&R Block , updating, importing the 2013 TT data from the TT file, and had no problems adding 2014 itemizations and filing. I appreciated the lower cost than TurboTax. I appreciate the absence of nag and marketing screens and pop-ups that TurboTax inundated me with. I would have zero reservations to use H&R again, but might try Tax Act in 2016 if it is a better price. Goodbye forever Intuit!"

5,"I don't think anyone would complain about Microsoft Office. The 2010 version is definitely different from my old 2003 version, but it does have more fancy functions and icons to do the work. Amazon got a great price that I was able to purchase below the price offered in other electronic stores."
1,"I have used this program for about 15 years. This year I was very disappointed. I was an enrolled agent some years ago, so I believe I have a better than average knowledge of income taxes. I needed to use a form not used commonly, Form 982, while preparing my son's taxes. When I clicked on help, it said the program does not support this form. It said to open the form, fill in the figures and close the form. I researched on the IRS website.<br /><br />Next morning, I called H & R Block support. It is only technical support, not tax support. The only way you can get tax support is by live chat. I put live chat in the search bar and it kept telling me their live chat did not support my web browsers. I have a new computer with the latest versions of Google chrome, Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox. Back to researching the IRS website. The support technician told me to call the IRS. If I have to do that, why did I buy a tax program that is supposed to have unlimited tax support?"

3,"I have used Intuit's Quicken for many years and have considered Intuit to be one of the best software companies around. However, I was not completely satisfied with my Quicken Deluxe 2009 experience. First of all, since 2007, Quicken has not had a Basic Edition for around $30. I don't need a Deluxe Edition for around $50. That is why I didn't upgrade in 2008, but had no choice in 2009 if I was going to upgrade at all. When I installed Quicken 2009, the program would not run. The Quicken logo flashed on the screen and disappeared. I restarted and reinstalled Quicken. I had the same problem, so I checked what support options I had, as I had never had to contact Intuit support before. I was disappointed, to say the least, that Intuit does not offer free telephone support, but warns of a $25.00 fee. Moreover, Intuit calls you back; you cannot call in directly to get a support agent. So I had to settle for Chat support. I did get the problem resolved, but it took thirty minutes, whereas it would have taken about ten minutes if I had been able to talk to a live person on the phone. It turned out that I did not have the right mapi32.dll. The Chat support agent did pick up this problem pretty quickly, and once the new DLL was installed, Quicken worked. The mapi32.dll problem may not have been Quicken's fault, but I first spent five minutes trying to find troubleshooting help on the Intuit web site, and this solution never came up. I had previously thought that Intuit's help information was the best in the industry. My opinion of Intuit has moderated from 5 stars to 3 stars. Quicken is still probably the best such program around, but 2009 may not be as trouble free as it has been for me over the last ten-plus years."
4,"About six months ago, my trusty XP computer that I had used for many years quit working. I knew I didn't want to move to Windows 8 with all the complaints about it not running half the programs I have come to love over the years, so I bought one with Windows 7. I was able to load most of my older and well-liked programs, but was VERY sad that one of my favorite programs of all time wouldn't load - Lotus Organizer. It is, by far, the best program of it's kind ever made!!! I loaded it on my laptop running Vista just so I wouldn't lose all of my contacts or my Christmas Card list, and quit using the daily calendar and to-do functions all together, and started using the crappy alternative in Office. Well, I'm happy to report that I found a version of Organizer that works perfectly in Windows 7 in this suite of programs, and I couldn't be happier!<br /><br />There are a couple of things I wanted to mention for those who have been trying to do the same thing. First, this entire suite loaded on my Acer running 64 bit Windows 7 flawlessly. Word Pro is almost the same as I remember AmiPro from years ago, and Lotus 1-2-3 is SO much better than Excel. However, if you try to upgrade (convert) your .or2 file from Lotus Organizer release 2 like I did, you'll be disappointed that it won't convert, even if you compact it first. I'm not sure why this version 5 won't convert it because it says it should. But, don't give up like I almost did. The way I worked around this was to export the contacts, anniversaries and any other categories in the older version of Organizer as either ansi or ascii text files and then imported them into the respective categories in this newer version. Every file came through flawlessly doing it that way. After a number of months missing my trusty old Organizer, it's back - and just as good as ever!!!"

1,"(this review is of the Spyware edition) <br />NIS takes 25Megs of ram - ok for an all-in-one (if you have &lt;256Megs your lightweight CPU can't carry enough armor to make Windows really Zero-day Net safe IMHO) <br /> <br />NIS has most of the features I look for in a firewall/spyware/virus scanner/intrusion detector, BUT <br />half don't work right, and some that do seem to fight every attempt to make them work. <br /> <br />Even after LiveUpdate this week, <br />One buggy automatic firewall rule autoloaded, and port 80 was open listening half 'naked' on the Internet. <br />I replaced it, and at the first passing probe my rule was erased, autoreplaced, naked again. <br />Only after I stumbled onto the secret trick (add a block all rule after the pass rules) did it close it. <br />It took 11 clicks (!) just to add the block all rule - miserable! <br />The log is a nightmare - pages of long sentences explaining \\""permitted once\\"" 200 times, no actual info <br /> until I click on one of them. What's worse is, none of them I checked WERE \\""permitted once\\"" IIRC. <br /> <br />NIS detected 2 trojan/spywares, but could not remove either. <br /> <br />Enabling program component monitoring started an avalanche of popups, all suggesting I block access, but I actually DO want IE to access the internet. <br />Running Windows update brought a popup asking if 100's more dll's are ok. How would I know? I do want Windows updated. <br />Great feature in theory, totally useless even if you know the names of every evil dll not yet invented. <br /> <br />If you have more than 1 or 2 programs not in the automatic ruleset, plan to either \\""permit all\\"" or spend many hours actually writing the same set of 3 rules over and over for every autoupdating program you use - assuming you understand TCP vs UDP etc. Why no \\""permit all local + DNS + outbound port 80\\"" choice? That would mean 1/10 the work! Jetico lets me pick \\""web browser\\"" ruleset, so its UI from Hell gets used once per category. <br /> <br />After spending all day and half the night getting it working, I discover that it is not possible to save my precious rules - or to reload them. I would be less furious if I had a fresh install of windows, but not much. <br /> <br />All good, until a program autoupdates, and 3 more rules to write. Too angry for words. <br />Jetico lets me clone the old rules or edit them to update the program sig. <br /> <br />I would not use NIS if you paid me 10 times its price. <br />"

5,"Could you imagine being able to write a site like Amazon.com from scratch? Well if you master everything in this title you will have the basic knowledge toward that end. Even though he creates a real contact management system, the theory is similar and you can continue from there. I taught Math and Computer Science professionally, and I bought this tutorial to learn the specifics of putting together a dynamic website using PHP (I'm a Java, VB, SQL, and C/C++ programmer). I may be a bit biased with my background, but this guy is a top notch instructor and speaker. I sat thru the entire course, even though what I was really interested in was the very practical website he sets up at the end. Many of the concepts in php are built on C and Java. Although its not a language that would win any awards from the Computer Science community (extremely loose typing for example), it is EXTREMELY powerful and will make writing web applications faster and easier. The array and string processing functions are nothing short of remarkable, and make it SO much easier for a new programmer to write effective programs. One line of code turns a delimited string into an array, or vice versa. Sure you can do many of those things in C++, but you would have to be an expert programmer. PHP is wonderful. There is also considerable background on SQL/databases. This title is well worth the money, this course in a private college would be well over a grand. He takes you from installing the necessary software to finalizing a website that can be developed into something much larger. If you have even the slightest background in programming you should be fine. I would give this 4 1/2 stars if I could, because it may require some extra effort for the absolute beginner. If your computer experience consists of web surfing and MS office, depending on your aptitudes you may find it a bit difficult, the same way some people find foreign language or music difficult. Others can start speaking Chinese from a web tutorial. Again it depends on you. I would strongly suggest a pre-requsite of Basic HTML and CSS from free sites such as w3schools (google for others), maybe even a programming tutorial from there. However, the title is very good because many \\""easier\\"" tutorials will leave you feeling dry at the end and you won't really have anything to show for it. With my experience in teaching programming languages to newbies, you may have to devote many hours, pause the video and do some googling to solidify these concepts. Becoming a great programmer needs time, patience, and dedication. Do not expect to simply watch the videos and become and expert. Bring a notebook and take notes, type each example into the text editor. Sometimes he will ask you to complete something that he started, and I would be a bit intimidated if I were totally new to programming. I suggest going through those exercises two or even three times until you completely understand it. Again, consider spending a few hours a day for a month to master this material if you are COMPLETELY new to programming. A professional programmer may pick up php fluency in less than a week. This video would be great in a corporate setting to cross train front end web personnel into programming if they are working on a project. Also, considering how web-centric the world is today, even management and non-technical types would benefit from the intimate understanding of what goes into a dynamic-data driven website(he gets into business analysis of the programming situation). Even if you aren't going to do the programming, understanding this title can help you leverage other resources and help you get the best result. Mr. Skoglund also has an advanced PHP video published[...], I will probably be purchasing that too in the near future. http://www.amazon.com/MySQL-Beyond-Basics-Kevin-Skoglund/dp/1596715413/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1253132473&sr=1-3"
1,"Last year I was Forced to buy Quickbooks 2010 as many things like sending PO's to customers was no longer available. There are things that I do like, the Company Snapshot but the ad's and the constant barrage of \\""Pay for this service\\"" and it's built in obsolesces have show me not to trust Intuit. When they start to remove services so that they can sell me the next version I would prefer moving my company to a ledger book and buying a bunch of pencils at Staples! I will not buy from this company again as they are not trustworthy and will be looking for alternatives over the next 2 years."
5,Great software.
3,"Very hard to understand program, plus they want me to purchase another add on to go with it. This program might be good for a master, will take for ever to understand it."
4,"Nice, received like new! I would recommend buying. It has a lot of fonts to use on my Mac computer"
5,"If your on any kind of budget and start choking when you see $500 or $1,000 for 3D software this is an excellent product. Bryce 5 has an easy to learn interface that allows you to move and alter objects, change atmosphere, and change camera views without having to beat it with a stick. The program lets you save objects, textures, and atmospheres you've created into the program so that they're always there when you come back. It also comes with alot of preset object and textures you can use, so you can create an image the first time you open the program. This isn't the program you want if your trying to do complex character animation, but it's really good for landscapes, architecture, and background. If your not sure this product is for you go to a few 3D sites and look at images people have made with Bryce 5. I've been using it for a year and I'm really happy with it."
3,"Bought this upgrade to install over Windows XP on an older computer with 3 gigs RAM. Installation went smoothly. I don't have a touch screen monitor, but you can easily get to the more recognizable desktop with one click. My main complaint is that several of my old programs don't work with this OS. Those that do work seem to be just fine, It's a new OS so will take some getting used to. It seems like it was designed to try to make the desktop interface match that of the Smart phone and tablet computer."
5,"Any big-name personal software product, there's probably a &#34;Professor Teaches&#34; for it. These series are well-designed. You can learn in short segments, just a few minutes a day if you like. You can learn basics, or you can go deeper into more advanced features. Nice combination of typical screen demonstrations, having you rehearse manipulating how to do things, and an audio track explaining the thing as you go along. Other helpful features include choosing the location of installation if you like, choosing whether to download all of it or just key parts if space is limited, and picking up where you left off last session. If you want to understand Office 2013, this is a handy product--and the prices for their products have been dropping over the years too."
5,"I orginally used Norton for years but after purchasing a new computer at Best Buy over a year ago, Kaspersky was installed on it. I have liked it better than Norton and have become a Kaspersky customer. When my 2011 ran out I searched for the Cheapest buy and found the 2012 here on Amazon."
4,Symantec tech support helped me to tweak my Outlook Express and get Norton AntiSpam to work as advertised. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it didn't work on my system right out of the box.
1,"This program slowed my computer and had a lot of irritating popups that were asking \\""do you want to . . . \\"" In addition I had a re direct virus that it did not get rid of. I had to download a pc tools anti spy program to get rid of it."
5,"I purchased french 1+2 about 2 months ago after I tried the demo session on their website. I love how the material is arranged and I always feel I am learning gradually at a nice pace every session. I just finished the french level 1 today and I am going to continue to level 2 immediately. I already got 3+4+5 after it's released before thanksgiving, and I am sure I will continue to learn with the program and will not give up. thanks Fluenz team for putting this wonderful program together, you are really really helping me learn something i never thought i can :)"
5,Easy to install and easy to use. I like the interview format. I would recommend this to a friend without hesitation.
5,"I've used Turbo Tax for many years now and never had a problem. It goes well with my Fidelity Account, Bank accounts and my Quicken software. Combination keeps home accounting organized and accessible."
5,"I used XP until win7 was released. I still maintain two XP PCs for things that were never upgraded. I liked it a lot, matched my style and was stable. WIN7 was flexible, handled new hardware well and was a real workhorse. Easy to master, once mastered, never had to do any head scratching. I just looked on the internet if I was stumped and there were many good answers.<br /><br />I am not real thrilled with the changing of WIN PC OSs, but one has to change to keep up with changes in hardware and software."
4,"I just took on setting up my first small office network. We have four computers and a desktop that someone set up to run as a server. The 6 gig harddrive had long seen its time and needed to be replaced. I bought a Dell PowerEdge SC420, 4 Windows XP Professional upgrades (from Amazon at an amazing price and current rebate) and Windows Small Business Server 2003 (also at a great price). I've worked on PC's for years but never set up a office network with a server. I was very apprehensive and questioned my skill but this software honestly was ridiculously simple to install and deploy. <br /> <br />It guides you through the entire process step by step and I recommend it highly to anyone looking for their first server software. Of course it does have some very technical aspects that left me scratching my head but that's because I don't know what I'm doing. Setting up Sharepoint and Exchange will require some further reading on my part but shouldn't be that difficult to deploy. <br /> <br />I recommend this product very highly and didn't give it 5 stars because of my own inexperience and not being able to see what it can fully do. It also takes hours to install which is pretty typical for any Microsoft product. I did have the whole thing done in one Saturday though and it took about 8 hours altogether."
5,"Were I a member of the gaming Industry right now, I would be shamed to be taught what gaming should look and feel like and how it should be marketed by a small Eastern European company. Who of the multi-billion gaming \\""giants\\"" ever went back to improve a released game? Yet, there you have it: thanks to CDPROJECT gaming as an art-form is still alive and kicking!<br /><br />This was the most awaited fantasy cRPG in the past 3 years. Not only did the original deliver, but even more work has gone into truly improving it.<br />THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL cRPG GAMES I HAD EVER PLAYED - AND NOW IT IS GORGEOUS!<br /><br />The environments are detailed, realistic, and can be experienced from up close. Grass, flowers and tree branches moved in both FABLE and TITAN QUEST as well; these, however, seem so true I caught myself reaching for my...antihistamines! Weather affects and day-night alterations (you have to see the elongating shadows to believe them!) are just gorgeous! More importantly, these are not just eye-candy: certain NPCs and monsters appear only when the correct combination of time-of-day and weather coincide...The horizon is far and the clouds move in endless variations. It reminded me of the sky of the original UNREAL, another visually ground-breaking game at its time. PURE VISUAL MAGIC!<br /><br />The character (Geralt) can master both sword-fighting and magic spells (what is known as a Warlock). To some die-hard RPG fans this may seem like heresy, nevertheless, keep in mind that multi-classing is not unheard off. The movement repertoire for both practices are impressively designed. Especially the sword-fighting, it is at par to any console action game. And the spells (both offensive and defensive ones) are not less impressive.<br /><br />Free roaming? Yes and no. One can decide which parts of the map he will visit but loading is still needed to travel even annoyingly short distances. And since quests and side-quest still have to be completed, yes, eventually a subtle, yet ever present, directionality is present.<br />Looting and bartering? Aaah...yes, sort of. You practically never change the sword you start off with (although you do get to improve its abilities), whereas good armor is only a little easier to come by compared to PLANESCAPE. On the upside, you get to gamble, have romantic relationships (FABLE was full of great ideas after all!) and bribe for information, so trinkets have other uses as well.<br />Detailed character modifiers? Nothing like the AD&D rules. You gain talents (gold, silver & bronze) which you can spend to improve your fighting or magical abilities. Pretty much like the DIABLO or the TITAN QUEST abilities systems.<br /><br />So, apart for the slight action-cRPG handicap, I have only two other objections. First, the...camera placement. Once more the atrocious Aurora Engine (remember NWN2...?) will keep auto-placing it where it is bound to get on your nerves - as it targets your character even if that is not the most logical option. Yes, this has indeed improved compared to the original but one cannot teach an old dog new tricks.<br />Second, the controls. They need getting used to as the fighting combos are still easily ruined by clicking out of sync. You do eventually get the hold of it, however it keeps glitching.<br /><br />Nevertheless, its shortcomings are not enough to diminish the breath of fresh air this release brings to the scene. The Enhanced edition not only is a truly reworked game but it also comes full with detailed Manuals, beautiful Maps and all the extras that games used to come with in the good old days...<br /><br />Whereas the BALDUR's GATES saga was story-heavy but (by today standards) visually wanting and the NEVERWINTER NIGHTS series was found, well, wanting in all aspects, THE WITCHER is the dream cRPG that BIOWARE was supposed to be capable of releasing all along but never did - and its current EA bedfellows surely put a stop to such aspirations now. That game, however, is finally here - and not from whom you would expect.<br />A tip of my hat to CDPROJECT for keeping the ART-FORM of Gaming alive. Well done indeed!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!y hat to CDPROJECT for keeping the ART-FORM of Gaming alive. Well done indeed! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
5,Good Job.
1,"I just wanted to add my 1 star to the growing number of 1 star reviews. I am trying to draw up some basement plans to submit a building permit application. After several hours of learning and drawing walls, windows, doors, outlets, bathroom fixtures, and smoke detectors. I went to save it and I get a fault that says Unable to access the requested document. The file may be in use or you may not have sufficient access rights.

5,"I switched to Mac over 7 years ago. Many business programs, such as Quickbooks and tax software run on a Windows platform. The Mac version of Quickbooks is a shadow of the Windows version. Other programs such as Corel Draw are also Windows based.<br /><br />Rather than switching between Boot Camp or having a separate PC for these programs, Parallels makes it possible to run the business and graphics software from the same machine and very conveniently. It's only a click of a window to switch between operating systems and programs. The more RAM you have, the better everything works. I can have many programs open simultaneously and switch back and forth easily.<br /><br />I can print from Windows, through Parallels with the Mac printers. Parallels will recognize the printers, even when their IP addresses change after a restart. Very convenient.<br /><br />Mac offers a much more stable operating system than Windows. Windows based programs offer more productivity and efficiency. I am really grateful to have the benefit of both worlds."
5,My computer got infected from the internet. I bought this product and it cleaned up my computer in no time.
2,"Pros:<br /><br />1) capable of decent accuracy with modest training, and very good accuracy with more extended training<br />2) can keep up with relatively fast speaking meaning overall excellent speed of text generation<br />3) capacity to train multiple users and work within multiple dialects<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1) unreliable, crash prone, and buggy - this program needs major work<br />2) poorly sorted out Windows 7 correction dialog operations (ultra-slow)<br />3) program becomes unstable when microphone is turned off for protracted periods of time, requiring reinitialization and reloading.<br />4) program support is a joke - Nuance has to be the most arrogant software company in the world despite some hard working staffers (yup - worse than Microsoft!)<br /><br />It's almost impossible to be on the Internet or working with the computer and not be aware of Dragon's NaturallySpeaking 11.0. You would think from the relentless advertisement by Nuance that the program never makes a mistake, and allows seamless control of your computer while allowing you to dictate virtually everything. Unfortunately, the hype and promise fall well short of the program's actual functioning.<br /><br />Although quite good accuracy is possible with modest levels of training, and very good accuracy is possible in technical fields with training of technical vocabulary, the program's buggy operation, recurrent vulnerability to crashing, humongous speech files and subsequent painfully slow loading, and very slow correction interface (much lower for some reason on Windows 7 than on Windows XP) spoil an otherwise enjoyable experience badly.<br /><br />Although I am almost totally dependent on the program for professional writing (cranking out roughly 20 single spaced pages a day in a scientific area), I am continually amazed with how many rough edges the program has that Nuance seems to be oblivious to, because they recur from edition to edition. As but a small example of lack of attention to relevant details, the program within Microsoft Word does not use the specialized characters for quotation marks, but uses a generic and plainer character set, instead of the one generated within Microsoft Word. This means that if you want professional looking final product, you have to run a macro to replace their generic quotation marks with the proper special character. Although this is a small issue, it's just an example of so many ways in which the program falls down, and displays its lack of polish. It is amazing that despite five editions of the product which I have used that this issue continues, despite feedback from multiple users.<br /><br />Then there is the issue of loading and speed of operation. With a solid-state drive that gets to the Windows 7 desktop in 20 seconds, it takes 25 seconds to load speech files on NaturallySpeaking 11.0. In other words, an extremely fast hard drive loads a bloated operating system faster than it loads NaturallySpeaking 11.0. I hesitate to think how long it would take somebody to load speech files on the average 250 GB 5400 RPM hard drive. You could go out, mow your lawn, calculate your taxes, then do your email, and come back just in time to start dictating.<br /><br />Well, so what? Once the program is loaded, things should be okay, right? Well this is where again the program falls down. First of all, actually correcting things reveals a major bug in their Windows 7 code around keyboard input within the corrections dialog box. When you bring up the correction dialog box, you can't type characters without generating a long delay before the program somehow incorporates your keyboard input (roughly 10-12 seconds) - this is unacceptable waiting time for entering a couple of characters. Dictating or spelling out words within the correction dialog box produces somewhat snappier results, but is still amazingly slow, (again running this program on an extremely fast processor, with 6 GB of RAM, and one of the fastest 250 GB solid-state drives). It's scary to imagine how slow this program would be on the average system. In fairness, some of it appears to be a Windows 7 incompatibility, because I use the same speech files and the same 11.0 version on a Windows XP system, and had much snappier response from within the corrections dialog box. Of course Nuance advertises that their code is Windows 7 compatible - something got lost in the translation. But again, this suggests that Nuance is more concerned with their advertising than with the program's actual performance. This is a continuing theme - Nuance's grandiosity gets continually in the way of their ability to see any problems with the program (or their support - which is clearly an industry low-water mark).<br /><br />The biggest problem though is what happens when you put the program (at least 11.0 - corrected in 11.5) into Suspend by turning off the microphone- and by the way, you are forced to do this because if you simply tell the program to \\""go to sleep\\"" any sound into the microphone will cause the page to scroll back to where the cursor is (in other words any kind of sound acts as a reinitialization command to the cursor - the logic behind that completely escapes me! So essentially you are forced to suspend microphone input if you want to scroll through your text instead of the program intrusively interfering with this. This is where things get really interesting (after you turn the microphone off). After about 5 min., the program will malfunction (again only in Windows 7 and not in Windows XP for some strange reason) and give you an error code which the program cannot recover from, and thus all this nonsense requires that you basically start from scratch all over again. This means not simply reloading the program, because the program actually doesn't pull itself out of memory reliably and oftentimes leaves a huge executable sitting in the background (taking up over 300 MB of RAM) - - if you don't kill the program this way, when you try to reinitialize it, you will immediately get the same error code. This means you have to bring up Task manager, find the program, and manually terminate it, and then start from scratch and reload your speech files. This will again take a long period of time - close to 30 seconds with a solid-state drive, A minute and a half with a slow conventional hard drive. All of this nonsense of course significantly deteriorates the productivity advantage associated with dictating versus typing. Indeed, for short pieces of text, all these hassles mean that it is almost always faster to simply type out a couple of paragraphs then it is to struggle with the program. For longer text generation, and assuming that you dictate continuously and don't risk putting the microphone into the off position for any extended period, the program is more productive and faster than typing.<br /><br />This process of recurrent shutdown and reinitializing (due to fatal program errors) can be very frustrating, and oftentimes has to be repeated multiple times, because if you leave the program on (by not turning off the microphone), and there is any background noise you'll get endless junk words into your dictation space. This brings up another striking failure of the program - its total inability to discriminate speech from background sounds and non-speech noises. The program seems to believe that every conceivable sound must translate into a word, and therefore, any kind of background noise makes it impossible to use the program particularly if you are not using a noise canceling microphone, and instead are dictating on a laptop that has a standard integrated microphone. You would think that the program, which runs on an enormous number of laptops, would be optimized for the standard integrated microphones on laptops. Unfortunately, it is not. You have to use Dragon's headphone microphone gear or some equivalent. Curiously, a much earlier version of the program NaturallySpeaking 8.0seem to work much better with laptop microphone arrays. Why this might be is beyond me.<br /><br />Because the program code is buggy and unreliable and subsequently the program locks up, you will find that occasionally your speech files are completely trashed and cannot be repaired through Nuance's repair algorithms (there is a speech file Restore function from within the program). This means you had better make a backup copy of your speech files (make that several backup copies), or you will find yourself having to retrain your user identity all over again, from scratch. Additionally, you will find that their optimization program (which gives you the chance to optimize speech files that have had numerous corrections made to them) is not reliable and also locks up regularly. And BTW, its continual crashing will occasionally damage programs with which it is linked, such as Word and Outlook, requiring re-installation of those as well. In other words, this program does not play nice with your system.<br /><br />In case you're suspicious that these difficulties are unique to my machine, or are a function of viruses, spyware, or other hardware problems, rest assured that none of these issues are remotely responsible for the Programs buggy and unreliable operation. I run two spyware and antivirus programs concurrently, my system is about as fast as a window 7 system can be (Windows experience index 6.7 overall), and I always keep the machine in good working order. Just to clarify, I do tech support for most of my friends on their Windows 7 and Windows XP systems - so the problem isn't that I have a damaged Windows installation that is to blame for these issues.<br /><br />All of these operational headaches spoil what otherwise might be a useful program. I believe that all of this emerges from Nuance having a very grandiose notion about their software, and not really listening very much to end-users. It's a shame that there is no real competition in the PC marketplace when it comes to dictation software. If there was, I suspect Nuance would have to get their act together because they would quickly lose market share. Given all these issues, 2/5 stars is actually generous. I wish I could make do without the program, or transition to another speech recognition platform, but unfortunately I can't.<br /><br />Oh, I almost forget the best part: don't expect Nuance to know anything about any of these issues. They have some of the worst technical support I have ever seen in the industry. They blame your system and your computer and claim there are no deficiencies in their program(!).<br /><br />ADDENDUM:<br /><br />Dragon 11.5 has just been released and after several weeks - I can see that Nuance has fixed some things, but not touched many others. It no longer crashes as frequently, or generates bizarre error codes as frequently, requiring that it has to be re-initialized regularly - although that still happens. It loads somewhat more quickly. However, it continues to interpret every sound as speech, has a painfully slow corrections dialog, and as per the norm, reaching technical support is like trying to call the Dept. of Defense and you don't have technical support past 90 days. It is painfully obvious that Nuance has no real handle on the program's deficiencies, and therefore it is a 2/5 star program. I can't recommend it.up Task manager, find the program, and manually terminate it, and then start from scratch and reload your speech files.

Will save you all the time and money you put into it when taxes time come. You will be able to track invoices, expenses, etc...easily."

3,"I purchased the smilebox software thinking it was a permanent use on my computer,little did I know it was actually a trial subscription.Love the software but i am unwilling to pay a monthly fee for its use."
1,"I'd give this 0 starts if I could. I installed this on my computer and when I tried running it, it kept saying put in the code to access it. I already did that. I contacted Adobe and spent 35 minutes with them only to have them say uninstall it and then reinstall it. Did that same results. I'd like my money back. DON'T waste your money on this. We have purchased several of the previous versions and have been really pleased, but this one really isn't worth the time and energy. Adobe support isn't good either. They ship it over to India and it's difficult to understand the directions they give you. Update: After getting a message to tell Adobe what they had to do in order to correct the problem, after explaining to them I had not a total grasp as the &#34;technical support&#34; did it. Brett then stated I was too vague and that was it. My wife has since then tried use the program and it's not as user friendly as previous versions---can't do as much with putting things side by side to organize files as with previous versions. I wish I didn't waste my money on this product---BUYER BEWARE!!!!! Customer service is horrible as is the product. I wouldn't recommend this version to anyone!!! Go with a previous version if you want adobe---we have 8 and it works a lot better"
2,"Sorry, but I could never get the hang of this software, was a bit too complicated for what I wanted to do and not very intuitive. I wanted a simple place to store my lists, copy/paste info from other sources, keep recipes, memos, info that interests me. I thought that a this notebook would work for me but realized that I just didn't choose the correct software. Ended up with \\""Notepad\\"" which fit my needs better."

Showing how sentences are structured and covering crammer is a lot more useful in the long run than just looking at pictures and knowing the word. If you dont want to just speek a language but LEARN a language, Mango is the way to go. Another great plus is that the company and support are great. From my experience, they are all very nice."

5,"Works as advertised. I took me 14 mins to create a image of my harddrive to an external firewire drive. The drive had 15 GB of data, and the compressed image was 8.5GB. I wanted to test it to make sure that the product actually works, so I've booted off the included recovery CD, all my controllers were recognized even thou my C: drive is all SCSI and mad up of 3 drives in RAID 0, while the D: drive is a IDE RAID 0 too. The firewire drive was recognized too, so I was able to select the backup image and strat the restore. After 20 min I was able to reboot my newly recovered drive. <br />The only issue I had is that I use a new motherboard that includes the Intel 1000/100BaseT network chip-set, and the PowerQuest recovery disk did not recognize it, so would've not been able to do a restore by using a network stored image. However this should not be a issue since in the online manual there is information on how to load drivers at boot time, I haven't used the procedure for now.<br />On more thing, this product is extremlly easy to use. All functions, including the recovery disk use the WindowsXP intreface, not DOS."
5,"I have used each version of this product for close to 10 years now to recover files that would otherwise be lost. Most recently, Mac 10.8 Disk Utility could not repair my system drive after it failed to boot. It even indicated that the disk had to be reformatted (erased). So I booted from an external hard drive loaded with the Mac OS and ran Disk Warrior from there. DW also indicated that it could not replace my directory with the one it had rebuilt. However (this is where the magic happens) the Preview feature was able to mount (make visible) my iMac's internal drive even though Mac Disk Utility couldn't.<br /><br />From there, I could copy my entire user directory from the iMac over to the external drive, erase the corrupted iMac drive, and start fresh with a new OS. Now I just have to copy my home directory back. I prefer running DW from an external drive because any DVD boot disc such as DW is going to be painfully slow. I recovered 15 GB of data in less than an hour with the external drive. I have dozens of such stories with this software, having used it with Mac friends and colleagues over the years, and thought it was time to give testimony."

I just spent over an hour trying to CHAT my way to resolution on a very basic problem that is inexplicably gob-smacking for them. Here is what happened: My bank changed their log in system and made me select a new username and password. Once I did that, I attempted to update Quicken, but now it won't connect to that bank. Something in the Quicken software doesn't like the change and though I can log in to the bank through a web browser just fine, in Quicken it won't work. Now I have to wait 3-5 days for some advanced department to review my log files and get back to me. Something like this happened last year and back then they fixed in in an hour while I talked to them on the phone. Not having phone support sucks!<br /><br />FEB 2, 2015: Email from Quicken. This is verbatim and the English is extremely poor.<br />Hi XXX,<br />Here is the incident number of our chat session: xxxxxx-xxxxxx.

Are you going to fix this problem? Right now it is a manual process for me, which is painstaking and not worth it.<br />Thank you,<br />XXX<br /><br />FEB 13, 2015: Email from me to Quicken<br />It has been 8 business days and I have heard nothing. Please respond back with a resolution.<br /><br />FEB 13, 2015:<br />I initiated a new chat session to ask for an update. First I was told that work on my issue had halted because I had deactivated my account and that they were waiting for me to reactivate it. This is complete rubbish! Moreover, no one tried to contact me about anything like that - which would have been a requirement. After I said all of this, they quickly recanted and then said they were still working on it and that I would hear back in 2 days.<br /><br />FEB 17, 2015: Email from Quicken<br />Dear Quicken User,<br />Thank you for contacting Quicken Customer Care<br />We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience that this issue may have caused you.

5,Excellent we have had this for 3 years and is still a hit with my little guy. Any Preschool to early k-2 grades will enjoy this.
5,"Easy to use, great results. I do videos for Minneapolis Television Network, this has been a great tool for making professional looking videos."
5,Works good and easy to use.
5,Perfect for doing 5 or fewer returns. Intuitive and easy to use.
5,"I agree with most of the other reviewers here, Easy Media Creator 7 is a great product. It installed fine - albeit slowly - and has performed without a problem since day one. Over the first couple of months of use, I had a couple of questions that I emailed to Roxio's customer support and they were quick to get back to me with answers. Overall it was easy to learn; even my wife and kids use it regularly. We use all aspects of the product and give it a big \\""thumbs up\\"" rating and recommend it to everyone. We even bought another copy of it and gave it away as a present to my brother and his family out on the west coast. Now we can easily create and share family pictures, movies and projects with one another. It's actually turned into a little sibling rivalry as to who can outdo the other."
5,Good product!
1,"I thought an inexpensive A/V with the great ratings BD had received would be a good move. I was terribly disappointed. After installing on 3 machines, all suffered significant slowdowns. The laptops would hang when coming out of suspend, program completely blocked my wireless NIC, took special firewall exceptions and multiple reboots to get it to function. Update is intrusive and timing is poor, browser is noticeably slow with BD running. Product is only suitable for use on a machine that has a constant high bandwidth internet connection. Completely unsuitable for portable machines.<br /><br />No less than 3 requests for support went unanswered. The 1st couple of \\""we're sorry you're having a negative experience, visit our website and fix it yourself\\"" replies were prompt, but once I asked for specific solutions to problems, silence. I asked for a refund... silence. I will have my credit card provider do a chargeback based on the non-response to support requests.<br /><br />I have removed the program from all my machines, and went back to ESET Nod32, more expensive, but won't screw up my machines, and good protection.<br /><br />Can't rate it with \\""no stars\\"" but would give it negative stars if possible! Simply terrible!!"
4,"I always wanted to get the full Photoshop software, but it is very expensive and very complicated to learn. I originally wanted to purchase just the Photoshop Elements software, but then I saw this package that also included the Premiere video editing software. I figured that I could really use some video editing software that offered more than the software that came with my Canon HD Video Camcorder. I was very happy with the purchase. The Elements picture editing software is great and it will challenge me with features yet to be understood for some time. While I have just started using the Premiere video editing software, it seems to be great too. It has reinvigorated my son's use of his GoPro HD video camera as he finds it easy to trim video clips, enter transitions, transition to slow and fast motion and add music. It also allows him to upload his videos to YouTube right from the software."
2,"If you're just a plain home user who do not want to bother customizing your personal firewall's policy, this is the firewall for you.<br />On the other hand, if you would rather have a mix of a smart firewall that also gives you the flexibility of fine tuning rules to your needs.... open certain ports (tcp or udp), let certain applications access the internet,... this software can be a bit confusing.<br />Though the 2002 version lets you do it, it takes a lot more extra steps for one to customize the packet filtering which is a total pain. The 2001 version is a lot more flexible and geared towards the more &quot;savvy&quot; user.<br />This is one of the few products that pretty much isn't worth an upgrade if you have an earlier version.<br />On the plus side, functionality is great, it provides good protection and a simple interface."
5,Works fine.
2,"Decided to give the software a try. Bundled in with a computer purchase. Machine is a middle-shelf 64 bit Windows 8 laptop from a big box outlet. (Purchased specifically for low level college lab work.) Saw all low threat research related web browsing (absolutely no social media, porn, gaming etc). Attributed poor computer performance out of the box to hardware shortcomings.<br /> Upon expiration of the six month Trend Micro license the software was replaced and a complete scan was performed with a new product. Numerous malware found by the new product that had been missed by Trend Micro Titanium.<br /> In fairness, the software was not able to scan the laptop that frequently. It was rarely left on when not in use. It may have performed 6-8 full system scans during the period.<br /> More significant, I noticed that the Trend Micro add in for the two different web browsers I tried to use created instabilities when accessing content on my college websites. The browser would \\""lock up\\"" or the homework site would freeze/time out. Flash videos and other media objects were not always accessible. Again, I attributed this to a discount laptop purchase. But this problem has been remedied by the removal of Trend Micro Titanium from this machine. The change was compelling enough to prompt me to write this review."
5,Since I have the program my English Pronunciation has improved a lot! It has given me the opportunity to practice at my own pace. The program is very complete and easy to use I was taking English classes at a Community College and Pronunciation Patterns was better than the class itself! I highly recommend it!!!!!!
4,"The only reason I gave Ghost 14 four stars is because during the backup screens you do not see all the partitions on your hard drive in the default configuration. A novice user would not know that other hidden partitions exist on their computer and would probably not backup them. If the purpose of Ghost 14 is to backup an entire computer then the user should see all partitions that exist on their hard disks as the default configuration. Let the user hide any partition as an option since I know hidden partitions are important too. If your hard disk fails you do want everything back including the hidden partitions. In my opinion the menu configurations of Ghost 14 are more complicated than what it needs to be for the average user. Gone are the days of Ghost 2003 when Symantec would allow a home user to backup all his computers at home with a single copy of Ghost. Now we must all purchase one license of Ghost per PC. The only Reason I purchased Ghost 14 was because DELL messed up their bios on my new laptop so Ghost 2003 would not work with their USB ports. Ghost 2003 would allow you to create your own boot CD disks if you knew how to create boot CD disks with Nero and knew how to modify batch files. You were able to boot Ghost from a CD and backup your entire computer to an external/internal drive or burn a CD or DVD backup. Ghost 2003 is still able to backup all my other computers with Windows Vista and Windows XP (32bit and 64bit versions). The Ghost 14 bootable CD only restores images and does not have any backup software available so it behaves like a rescue CD. All backups in Ghosts 14 are conveniently done when logged in to a Windows XP or Windows Vista account unlike Ghost 2003 which requires you to use a bootable CD, USB Drive, or floppy disks."
5,I wanted the MS office Home & Student 2010 with 3 PC because of the 3 PC and one price is nice too. Just can't beat that!!
1,"This product nearly destroyed my computer. Even basic desktop functions disappeared--no icons, no taskbar. Blue screens...name your worst nightmare...this product is it.<BR>McAfee website Help is No Help. I tried the $2.95 a minute route, and couldn't get through.<BR>McAfee's Uninstall program failed mid-way, and wouldn't re-run.<BR>Ultimately, I paid a computer consultant $270 to remove this trash from my computer.<BR>I was testing this crashware because I approve software purchases for my company. Believe me, no McAfee product will EVER be purchased by my company again."
4,Overall the software has been good. But it seems to have slowed my computers performance a bit. But it does the job.
5,Had a hard time downloading was redirected to Q/A section followed the suggestion they had and it downloaded just fine.still testing out product but so far so go
3,"Software doesn't translate position from GPS to the position in the calculated route. So, there is no coming turns notifications, current miles/estimated time to destination or automatic route recalculations. Also, sometimes you have to restart application after system standby because it stops recognizing GPS receiver."
3,"I usually love apple's upgrades but this one is stinky! The new iPhoto, iDVD and Garageband are cool but not tremendously different but the new iMovie took a step backwards! I really kinda hate it. It's so dummied done it's rather useless. I guess it's time for me to move on to Final Cut Pro."
1,This was ordered by mistake.
5,I have bought many of these jump start CD's and I am never displeased. This is a really great way to keep your child on track with their education while playing games. These are the best.
5,"First off, I am here to testify that Parallels 4.0 is the best solution to running Windows apps on Mac OS X. I have tried Crossover (Crossover Games too), VMWare Fusion 2.0, and Sun's Virtual Box. Crossover([...]) is a good solution if you just want to run one windows app but anymore and it becomes a really big headache (if are not a computer engineer/programer). Virtual Box ([...]) is great if you like free stuff but again same thing with Crossover, if you are not a computer engineer/programmer it's a very difficult application. VMWare Fusion 2.0 (http://www.amazon.com/Smith-Micro-Software-Inc-VMFM20BX2/dp/B001F5VBRU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=software&qid=1252022776&sr=8-1)is great to run Windows apps but can be slow at times. I first bought Fusion about a month ago. I have been reviewing all of these products since I bought my Macbook Air, yes I said Air, in January 2009: these are my results. I tried VMWare first because at that time it had the best reviews. These are the operating systems I have used on VMWare Fusion 2.0 and Virtual Box: Linux Ubuntu 9.04, Windows XP Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate (32-bit RC), and Sun Open Solaris 10. VMWare doesn't work with Open Solaris very well (I haven't tried Open Solaris with Paralles yet), in Virtual Box Open Solaris worked pretty good. I say this up front Windows XP works great with all three virtual machines, not a problem. Windows 7 does not work in Virtual Box, period but works in VMWare Fusion 2.0 very slow. Windows 7 runs great under Paralles. Crossover doesn't even support anything past Windows XP. Ubuntu 9.04 worked pretty well with VMWare Fusion and Virtual Box (again, haven't tried Paralles yet). The biggest issue I found with Virtual Box is the fact that wireless internet is not useable in the guest machine nor does shared folders work at all (on any of the OS's). The biggest issue with VMWare Fusion is friendliness, Paralles just looks much better and again just works without issues. Overall, I rate this product to be the best of the best virtual machines out there to date. NOTE: IF YOU WANT A PRODUCT THAT JUST WORKS GO WITH PARALLES 4.0. PERIOD.to be the best of the best virtual machines out there to date. NOTE: IF YOU WANT A PRODUCT THAT JUST WORKS GO WITH PARALLES 4.0. PERIOD."
5,THIS THE BEST ANTI VIRUS I HAVE EVER USED! IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL DO AND MORE. I WILL ALWAYS USE IT!
3,"I think this can be a fun suite of programs if you like to speculate about how a new project in your house or yard might turn out. A reasonable library of materials and a relatively simple design process allow you to create rough approximations. <br /> <br />There are software limitations, however, that will frustrate perfectionists. Design angles are limited to 7.5 degree increments, for instance, so getting the exact angle of your hedge, angled sidewalk, or slanted driveway may not be possible if that angle isn't divisible by 7.5 degrees. <br /> <br />Another example of limitations is that the roofing application makes no provision for certain circumstances in which two sections of roof have different slopes. The result is that you can't really recreate the roof on an L-shaped house unless the two branches of the L are the same width. I thought this was a user error until I found that the tech support solution was to widen the thinner section of the house to get the roof to line up right. <br /> <br />In short, the program is not going to provide architectural specs for a house or a reliable blueprint for landscaping your yard. Perfectionists will have to just \\""let it go\\"" after a certain point. That having been said, the software IS fun if you are the sort of person who enjoys design software. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />"
5,"Update was done automatically after program installation. Filing taxes is just as easy as in previous years. I don't get the state option anymore since it's just a few more questions to answer. Also, e-filing state taxes costs $25 per return.<br /><br />The amazon card rebate bonus is the main incentive for this version. Instructions aren't very clear but the entire refund to your bank account option must be selected for you to see the amazon gift card slider. If you choose to split your refund or get savings bonds, the amazon card option is not shown."
5,"If you're looking for service after your purchase, look no further than Cook'n 10, by DVO Enterprizes. I returned to the Cook'n arena after being away for several years. Not wanting to discard my old Cook'n DVD purchases without exploring the possibilities of using them with the current version of Cook'n, I contacted Cook'n Tech Support. Their rapid response - same day - assured me I could. An entire page of my previous purchases, with downloadable links followed for me to install and use. I was elated with that level of customer service<br /><br />Upgrades are frequent; Tech Staff is available to address individual issues while it pursues the \\""neat stuff\\"" and the \\""wouldn't it be great if... stuff\\"" for future releases. I recently had a \\""crash\\"" and simply could not recover my Cook'n program. Tech Support had me up and running - with upgrades on day 2 along with Cook'n Cloud. Yep they have the Cloud now and it works beautifully. I understand the Cloud will be available for the iPhone, ipad and Galaxy in the not too distant future. Frequent new books are available which keeps the Cook'n concept fresh and in my opinion ahead of its competitors.<br /><br />I share all of this because every word has applied to me and my experiences since last November and I simply would like others contemplating the purchase of Cook'n Recipe Organizer, v.10 know what's ahead as it relates to \\""service after the sale'. DVO cares about its people and its customers."
5,good
5,"We have two teenage boys in our house and have had some issues with some innappropriate computer usage. So far this does everything stated in the description and more. It does a good job blocking the sites as well as keeping a good record of everything they are doing including logging keystrokes and webpages, including screenshots of the applications they are using."
5,"Worked exactly as promised and no problems getting my 32 bit stuff to work. I had no problems installing this, its not a pirate copy and Microsoft recognized it as genuine. It came in unopened packaging with all instructions. If you need 64 bit Windows go with this instead of 8, you'll be much happier. Also don't get any version lower than Pro. A dirty little \\""secret\\"" of Windows is that your memory will be limited if you use lesser versions but Pro lets you use up to 192 gigs. One complaint though, it says its SP1 but its not, you'll have to use update to get it to SP1. Outside of that, its a good product from a good seller."
5,Excellent course. Exactly what I was needing. Good content and an opportunity to practice what was learned in the material
4,I had been using Sony for years and then came upon Cyberlink Director Suite. Pros: Great feature set. Great codec support. Easy to produce videos in any codec or custom output (via templates). Cons: Version 10 had some audio sync issues. Lacked render a portion of the timeline. Other: *Version 12 solved all the cons for me.
3,"Colors are not very faithful when painted on walls and have a rather limited palette. I could never find bookcases or adequate fireplaces. The roof is automatically generated so you can't really replicate your own roof,if you are doing a remodel,(unless it's really simple). Viewing tools are ok, measurement tools lack versatility. You can get a floor layout and view the 3D construction rapidly, but it really wasn't adequate to model my rather simple house. It's a good package if you only need to run some simulations to get rough ideas of what things might look like after a remodel."
5,I'M VERY SATISFIED!
4,The only thing I'm not that fond of in this package is the way the program deals with printers. Otherwise it's perfect for my needs (as always).
5,"I used Quark daily over three years for the design of a college newspaper. The program is a dream. It's a large program that won't run perfectly on older Macs, but it's well worth the RAM it hogs. Quark Xpress 4 (and its newer versions) are the industry standard, and for good reason."
5,Very good quality but not user friendly.
1,"If a company wants to charge more for an improved product because realistically they need to cover the costs that went into creating that better product, fine. But this new price structure is just garbage. Clearly Intuit is at that point with TurboTax where they think people will stomach unjustified price increases because (a) changing software is annoying and (b) it's still cheaper than paying a tax professional. I hope they are sorely mistaken. I urge people not to be scared of trying a new product this year. I have used TurboTax every year since I started doing my taxes and am excited to move on to a new product this year."
5,Our sons love this course. Our 8 year old loves everything Minecraft so this was a win-win for us. I sit through the lessons and take notes just in case but they haven't need me or the notes. They enjoy the quizzes and troubleshooting mods just as much as the lessons. We are all always excited to see the items they have designed in the actual game. I appreciate the way that Justin explains it on a level that is easy to understand but continues to use the technical terms so the kids actually learn the coding language!! The skills they are learning have easily transitioned to other formats. Each lesson takes approximately 30 - 45 minutes. Some of the design lessons took longer just because of the creative process. Justin is very engaging in the videos and the lessons are far from boring. The order of each lesson builds upon the previous lesson and offers a quick review. We have no problems with crashing or videos/content that didn't load or play properly. We plan to do many more courses with youth digital.
1,"(This is a drastically revised review. My initial installation experience was good, and I rated the program 5 stars. Now I rate it at 1-star.) Here's the recap.<br /><br />I dreaded the upgrade from Quicken 2005 to 2008. I waited as long as possible, then validated my data, etc., and set aside a day when I thought I could stand the frustration. Whaddaya know, the installation went pretty easily, and soon I was up and running, intact, or so I thought. I use Quicken BillPay and have for years, and I have Windows XP Pro. My online billing proceeded normally, and I was greatly relieved. I even submitted a 5-star review. The program does little more than Quicken 2005 did, but the new eye-candy was pleasant, and the upgrade was mandatory. By waiting as long as possible to install, the program was already on Version 7 (God help early adopters!)<br /><br />Then I noticed that my checking account appeared as \\""Wachovia Securities\\"" when the correct account was and always has been \\""Wells Fargo\\"". I tried all the obvious ways to fix it, and nothing worked, so I thought I'd give the new \\""chat\\"" support a try. When it became clear that the things the support person suggested wouldn't work, she simply disconnected!! That solved HER problem. And I decided not to sweat it, since the erroneous name didn't seem to cause any other problems.<br /><br />But then -- I pulled up an old saved report from Q2005, and one column of data was garbage. This time I tried email support. Through an exchange of emails, they advised me to validate the file, and if that didn't work, to supervalidate it. I did all of that (very carefully, I had a backup, but by the way the normal backup you get is worthless, more on that), and it still didn't work. The email guy said I should phone in and talk to a support person.<br /><br />AND THEN I noticed that the validation process had ELIMINATED ALL RECORD OF ONLINE TRANSACTIONS AND ALL OF MY ONLINE PAYEE LIST, which was substantial!! Oh woe. This is when I tried restoring a backup file I'd made the day before. But get this: WHEN QUICKEN 2008 MESSES UP, IT DOES SO IN A WAY THAT PREVENTS YOU FROM GOING BACK TO A PREVIOUSLY FUNCTIONAL VERSION. Every old file I \\""restored\\"" now showed the same total absence of online transactions and onlinei payees. Now I did decide to phone in for support.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised: Without a long wait time, I was connected to a young woman in Bangladesh or some other remote location, but she was really really sharp and actually solved the problem. This was not trivial. I had to cancel my online billing setup, validate and revalidate and revalidate the file until no \\""corrected errors\\"" showed up, and then reinstate online billing. We basically took Quicken apart and put it back together again. She also corrected the account so that Wells Fargo showed up instead of Wachovia, although this was separate from the issue that had wiped out my online transactions. As far as the column of garbage in the saved Q2005 report, she said that Q2008 does that sometimes; I should just delete the report and recreate it. All these problems were solved, my online payee list was restored, and at that point, I was charged $24.95 for the call. I tried to argue that Q2008 had created the problem and corrupted my file, but decided to blow it off and just pay and be done with it. I thought my problems were over. Ha.<br /><br />BECAUSE THEN, when I next \\""updated\\"" my online accounts, Quicken Bill Pay downloaded the LAST TWO YEARS OF TRANSACTIONS, roughly 650, along with a few new ones interspersed. The balance in my checking accounted was now -$87,000. That's MINUS $87,000.<br /><br />In the next call to phone support I found out that \\""That's just how it is\\"". I would have to go through the last 2 years of transactions and manually delete the duplicates. (He did tell me to sort the account by \\""most recently entered\\"" instead of by \\""date\\"", so I was able to select groups and delete with only 1-2 clicks per transaction instead of the 4-5 clicks it normally takes to delete a transaction.) At the end of all this, my accounts have been somehow \\""unreconciled\\"" -- all records of the last month's reconciliation have been eliminated. So I'm having to redo that too. I don't actually expect my bank account to balance at the end of all this (How do you carefully and thoughtfully delete duplicate records when you're feeling like !@#%$?) I plan to just enter a fudge factor and forget about it.<br /><br />Here's some learnings: If you're converting from an old version, and you decide to validate the file before you start the conversion, keep rerunning the validation routine until it turns up no more error messages. They don't tell you this, but the sharp woman said that was important. Then you may or may not want to \\""super-validate\\"" which you do by holding down the shift key while you go thru the validation procedure.<br /><br />Then you can pray a lot. If your bank account name comes up wrong, try ignoring it. If your old reports look funny, delete and recreate them. Do anything you can to avoid using the Q2008 version of validation.<br /><br />If you need support, go immediately for the phone support. I talked to 2 people, and both knew what they were doing. The first woman was awesome (except for not telling me the horrors that would happen the next time I ran the online update). The second person, a guy, knew I was, well, screwed, and he tried to be as nice as possible about it. I have used Quicken since 1998, and I will say that support is better than it was a few years ago (not close to the way it was Back in the Day), and they don't charge you unless they solve the problem. The chat and email support were useless.<br /><br />All for now.a transaction.)

5,"I've been a Parallels user for some time and at the moment still use Parallels for a Windows XP installation.<br /><br />When VMWare Fusion first came out I had downloaded it, not because I was unhappy with Parallels, but because I needed to run an OS that Parallels couldn't install but that I knew worked under VMWare on other platforms.<br /><br />That OS is SCO Unix - I still have a handful of SCO customers left (just a handful, fortunately) so from time to time I need to access a SCO box to remind myself how something works or to test something before I inflict it upon my customer.<br /><br />As I hoped, VMWare installed and ran SCO perfectly. Well, almost - I still haven't got the mouse to work in the GUI but for my purposes I really don't need that - I can always vnc in if need be. I did have a little trouble getting the network to work - I wanted it to dhcp but it wouldn't, so I finally just gave it a hard address and all was fine.<br /><br />As it happened, the next day I needed to test something on the latest Centos so I installed that under VMWare rather than Parallels and of course that was 100% perfect - no issues whatsoever.<br /><br />I see that VMWare now has the ability to convert a Parallels install.. I haven't done that yet, but really, why should I run both of these?<br /><br />And Parallels does seem to be a very busy boopy - I happened to be running \\""opensnoop\\"" and noticed that Parallels has a LOT of activity.. I noticed nothing from Fusion during that same period. Now Parallels was running Windows and Fusion was doing Centos, so it might be Windows fault, but I would guess VMWare is going to be more efficient if it isn't already. I think they've just had more experience and resources.<br /><br />I've read many reviews that show Fusion as faster - and I do notice that my XP is slow.. of course XP is often sluggish anyway, but I think I'll be doing that conversion soon."
5,"I bought this from Amazon for about $19 incl shipping. It got to me by regular mail 4 days after I placed my order. $19/3 computers = $6.33 per machine for internet security. I previously tested all the major competitor's products in real time for 30 days each. Some passed a lot of malware, some bogged the computer down, some interfered with my e-mail and some allowed viruses to pass. I have run real-time tests with malware scanners and sandboxes on my machines. Of the several products I tested, this one has come closer to a perfect score than the others. My malware scanners come up with zero malware now most of the time and the competing products always passed some each day. This product is the least invasive of any other - meaning it doesn't bother me with pop-ups at all and doesn't slow my computers down. I worry less about malare and viruses now and enjoy my computer time most using this product. It auto-scans each day unnoticed. If I use the scan button, it takes less than 2 min to do a full scan. Add the fact that I got it so cheaply and fast, then I have something to be very happy about. How would I rank the competition? #2 Norton. (it's almost as good), like all the competition the scans take quite awhile. #3 Kaspersky - doesn't bog the machine badly but passes malware. #4 BitDefender - heavy program, does the A-V job effectively, passess malware, uses noticeable computer power. #5 ESET - not a resource-heavy program but I didn't test it as heavily as the rest but it gave me no real problems that I recall. AVG- best of all the free ones. Panda- it passed a Trojan to my machine. IOLO AV, crashes and needs re-install fairly often - I had it for a year. Very weak AV. Trend Micro - About as good as IOLO, maybe slightly better."
1,"I bought this product in October 2012 and it never seemed to work correctly. Later, I found that it needed \\""activation\\"". When I very carefully entered the 25 character product key, the program rejected it and refused to activate the program. By the time I got around to this the product was not returnable at Amazon.com and I was forced, by Amazon, to contact Microsoft for a fix.<br /><br />The Microsoft phone number initially offered by Amazon was incorrect. The second number offered by Amazon got through to a dispatcher who issued a service ID and was transferring me to a technical representative. That line was disconnected during the wait. I called Microsoft again with the ID and was told there would be a 19-35 minute wait. I insisted. Eventually, a representative verified that my original product key was valid, even though it wouldn't activate my software. She issued a new product key that worked and which eliminated the assorted problems experienced with the software.<br /><br />If you buy this Microsoft software:<br /><br />1. Failure to activate the software causes strange and unattributed problems.<br /><br />2. ===> BEWARE THAT THE PROVIDED ACTIVATION KEY MAY NOT WORK! <====<br /><br />3. If you don't act quickly, Amazon won't be of much help.<br /><br />4. Getting service from Microsoft is a painful and time-consuming task.<br /><br />The cost of time wasted would have paid the differential cost in moving to a Macintosh system. There's no future for a company who can't even do activation properly!"

5,"My first SAT and ACT scores were not good enough to get me into my first choice college. A friend had recommended this after her scores went up so I bought it. It was like having a private tutor helping me through the whole test. I loved the advice that it gave on test strategies, and the flash cards made it easy to remember the new things I was learning. The best part was the practice test which allowed me to see the areas that I could work on immediately and told me how to complete each problem correctly. I could take a small portion of the test at a time, save it, and come back to finish it later. If you want to boost your score for the SAT or ACT get this computer program now. It was easy to use and made studying fun. Plus I know that the strategies this taught me will help me excel on any test. Without this I would be going to a local state U, not my first choice school. Thank you for creating this; it really works!"
4,Been using H&R Block since the mid 90s. I came very very close to doing my taxes online this year but changed my mind. Too many unknowns and hidden costs scared me away. Got the H&R Block Deluxe + State for around $15. Cost of submitting the State was around $20. Next year I may try both and compare.

I have had this for a while over a year for sure and it still entertains me and makes me laugh and has improved my hand/eye/thought skills with connecting all those fuses every which way, capturing coins and jewels, snuffing bombs or clocks out, etc. my computer is windows XP."
5,"The transaction was the best you could expect, fast shipment, good communication, product was just as described. Good seller."
4,"I'm very impressed with the stability of this version. Also really like the new trace function. Possibly it's just that I'm not used to the program yet, but I prefer the node reduction in my older version, so am saving backwards and doing the node reduction in it for my sign cutting graphics. <br /> <br />I had a problem being able to get access to the templates on disk 4. I registered the program online, but it still took an email and waiting a couple of days *after* emailing them to get these unlocked. Also, I was not able to find a *free* phone number to contact them about this problem, so opted for the email instead. Hopefully by now Corel has fixed this registration glitch. <br /> <br />These things are minor, and all in all I really like this new version."
1,"After several attempts to install on Windows 7, I'm giving up - it keeps returning the same error, and the Rosetta Stone support pages only advice is to wipe and reinstall. There is a \\""highly recommended\\"" update that seems to take an hour to download and install on what is normally a fast connection, and then it wipes. (It won't let you just download a patch and save it, I've had to redo with each install.)<br /><br />Overall, a frustrating experience with no reward - just hoping I can get a full refund for this disappointment."
5,The Official Nintendo Wii Power Supply Adapter was everything it was advertised to be. It works great!
4,"I bought Parallels for Mac because of previous problems with other similar program, VM Ware. In all fairness, the VM product was a beta so I should have guessed it would be buggy, but even the non beta version had its fair share of bugs. Although VM Ware loaded XP home without a hitch, using the program was fraught with difficulties. First, it was slow as molasses in January. Im not taking just a little slow, Im talking go to lunch and maybe itll be finished slow. Secondly, it was prone to mouse failure. Although it would recognize my mouse, it was always at least 2 inches off the mark. If I wanted to click a box I finally learned to position my mouse at least 2 inches below the intended button and then click. Finally, VM Ware allows for the import of an existing Boot Camp partition (see below) but the process is slow and one slight misstep spells doom. For the novice, its intimidating. Then I went to Boot Camp, which is Apples built in Windows capable utility. It worked without a hitch but you had to reboot to either OS X or Windows and hold the option key to get a boot menu. Of note, Boot Camp runs Windows natively, that is, at the same speed as a regular Windows machine. Fact is, it runs quicker on a Mac! All you have to do is go to the Boot Camp utility (under Utilities in the HD icon) and it walks you through it. I got Parallels because I was tired of rebooting my computer to get to Windows. I use Quicken 2008 quite a bit and Quicken for Mac really bites so I do have to use Windows. With Parallels I dont have to reboot. How difficult is it to access the Boot Camp partition with Parallels? Well for starters, it takes about as long as reading this sentence. Once you install Windows into Boot Camp you then install Parallels in Mac. Upon opening Parallels the first time itll ask you if you want to import the Boot Camp partition with Windows on it. Click yes and youll get a desktop icon that states My Boot Camp. After afew minutes of tweaking youll have Windows running on your Mac desktop. Of course, its not all fun and games. For example, youll get a warning that your Windows serial number is no longer any good because of significant hardware changes on your computer. Not a problem. I called the Microsoft toll free number and they issued me a new serial number when I told them what happened. Also, until Parallels recognizes and installs your mouse in the window, youll have to revert to the old ALT routine (the underlined Y in Yes means you have to press the Y key to enter the command. Making things weird is that you sometimes have to hit the ALT or CTRL key, sometimes you dont. Go figure). Also, you must learn to read instructions. Your mouse cursor will be stuck in the Parallels window that appears. It will seem you cant get it out of the box. Read the bottom of the box and itll tell you to hit CTRL and ALT to get the cursor out of the box and back to Mac. It you go to full screen mode, youll have to remember to key in ALT and ENTER to access the Mac screen again (it merely minimizes the window that has XP or Vista in it). By the way, the default memory allocated to Parallels is 512 MB. Some may find this a tick slow and you can increase it to half of your available RAM if you desire (I have 4 GB so I could go to 2). I found 512 to be just about right, but Vista will require at least 1 GB. If done properly, Windows will act just as fast in Parallels on Mac as it does in Boot Camp. I could detect no discernible difference, but there are a couple things to remember: 1. If Windows is open in Parallels, shut it down as you would any Windows machine. Shutting it down by closing the window may make it crash. 2. Maximize the window for best performance. If you use the default window size things get really crowded very quickly. 3. Dont think you can get away using a hacked or cloned version of Windows. Parallels demands a serial number before it will load Windows, unless you import it from Boot Camp and then Windows asks for a serial number. Either way, youre out of luck if you attempt to use a fraudulent copy. For the price I paid (about $20 when I bought my Mac) you really cant lose with Parallels. It works as intended and actually runs Windows better than a Windows machine."

4,"After using the Magix Pro series for the past 3 years, I had an opportunity to run some competing video editors, including Sony Vegas and Cyberdirector, to see if there would be any rendering advantages in other software formats. I discovered that the nomenclature of most video software these days is so different between programs, that it requires a complete retraining of processes in order to get results, which I found myself unwilling to do. The 'comfort' of the Magix interface, coupled with a good book-sized publication included in the package, made it a compelling choice for me to decide upon acquiring MX Pro 18. While its rendering times are not the fastest in the industry, the amount of video and audio tools included in the package (audio recordists take note, this is as good as Pro Tools for a computer multitrack solution!) make the program one of the most powerful in its price range."

1,"I bought this sucker right here on Amazon because I too <br />had read the glowing reviews. I wanted to try something <br />other than McAfee and Norton and chose this. Had no <br />problem installing it, but it scans constantly <br />(and I have excluded many filetypes and folders from <br />scanning, with little improvement). It can take 5-6 <br />hours to do a complete scan, and interferes with almost <br />every program I use. It has caused printer errors, <br />freezes my graphics program and always hangs the <br />computer when I shut it down. <br /> <br />Don't buy this headache! Phone support is non-existant <br />and email's go unanswered for several weeks (if they're <br />answered at all). <br /> <br />Install it and you've got yourself the \\""HAL Version\\"" <br />of anti-virus programs (HAL--as in \\""2001,A Space Oddessy\\"") <br />--it takes over your machine, slows it down to a crawl, <br />and can be a nightmare to uninstall.

5,"Yes, there are free windows sites you can go to that SAY they can and will protect your computer, but NOTHING works like NORTON. I have actually purchsed other products that \\""claim\\"" that they can do what Norton does, but they cannot. Norton will actually WARN you if the site you are about to go on is dangerous for your computer. Norton runs it's own scans constantly, so you do NOTHING, but sit back, relax, and know that your computer is safe. Well worth the money, and if you are looking for Norton now, there is no place like Amazon to purchase it. You will find sellers with the lowest prices. I have purchased Norton two times now, for years 2010 and 2011, and will only look on Amazon when it is time for another one. A great product at a great price with the right seller.<br />Gayle Flores"
3,"I think the title says it all. It worked perfectly, easy instructions etc. But I can't for the life of me rationalize spending upwards of $250 for a standard piece of plastic with some foily stuff on it and a glossy cardboard sleeve. While I recognize the prowess and legacy of microsoft os's in general, I wish by now they would stop ripping off their consumers for many-year-old software or even just software in general. I'm not criticizing the product so much as I'm criticizing Microsoft's bad (or good, depending on which cushy leather office chair glossed with the blood of the poor you're sitting in) extortion of the american public. Smart business, or squeezing us dry?"

1,I regret buying this product. I spent $40.00 dollars on this software and I can't get a sign I can't copy and paste. I want my money back from the company this is a rip off.$40.00 for nothing.
5,Was just as it was pictured and delivered in good time. This program is one of the finest I have ever used. Enjoyed the effects that can be an enhancement to any picture.
5,The Software was delivered in a very reasonable time and price. Very satisfied with the product.
2,My daughter did not like this at all. It just didn't work very well and it had limited options of things to do.
1,"It must be downloaded upon each use. It does not hold your location during practice tests therefore, wasting time trying to find test question location. In summary, don't waste your money or time with this product."
1,"Have used turbotax for years, but can't get this year's CD version to load in my desktop. Same computer I had for last 3 years, but this disc isn't loading. HELP."
3,"Ok, I love my iMac and am a huge fan of Apple products. So when I read the reviews of iLife '09 and found reputable sources writing that upgrading was a \\""no-brainer,\\"" I put down my 70 bucks and bought the upgrade. The problem, for me, is this: The new features, such as guitar lessons in Garage Band and face recognition and GPS location tags for iPhoto don't add up to much. That is, I have found that I just don't use them. At all. I'm not claiming that this is a bad product--it isn't. I am suggesting, however, that the upgrade isn't significant from the perspective of users like me, who, busy with work and family, don't have much time any longer to practice guitar and who download home photos from the digital camera for storage and, in some cases, printing. Pretty basic applications. Any user who falls into the category of free-time-deprived basic user will probably regret spending the money for the upgrade."
3,"I had high hopes for this product. There is no doubt that the content is good , but accessing it is the problem. The full product takes over 4GB which is to be expected , but when it is loaded it really does slow my computer down & I don't have an old system. Also , it is not as quick as wikipedia. The recent debate about which is the better system is still running. Overall, I wld trust EB over the free system , but I do find the free wikipedia(sp?) easier to use & less of a burden on my computer. Overall , if you need a reference system I would find it hard to recommend. I have actually taken off my laptop as it really was 'boggin' every thing else down."
5,"I have upgraded 3 different PCs and laptops running XP to 7 and it has been a worthwhile upgrade. The speed at which the upgrade completed is quite fast and the driver/hardware detection was seamless. The machines run as fast as ever with new functionality and better stability (XP was pretty good about that too, in all fairness). All in all, I have been very happy with the update: fast, stable, compatible, and cool. What more could one want?"
1,I have Hallmark card studio 1 and 2 and I enjoy them immensely.. Then I bought the 'Scrapbook Studio'. I can not believe how hard it is to use. My husband and I have spent hours trying to figure it out. A lot of the art is good but the program should be scrapped. Hallmark should never have put their name on this one.
2,"For all that is good in the world, do NOT get Norton 360. It will suck up your computer's resources, slow it down, and cause you eternal frustration. For example, it runs \\""background scans\\"", meaning when the scan is running, it's in the \\""background\\"" and is not supposed to affect the performance of your computer while you're working. NOT TRUE. For the 10 minutes or whatever it takes for the \\""background\\"" scan to run, you're computer is so slow you effectively can't do anything. It's agonizing. Sure, you're supposed to be able to schedule the scans manually so you can run them when you want, but for whatever reason, the scans just keep running whenever they want. Also, when it is doing the \\""live update\\"" to get the most recent virus info, it's the exact same thing. Agonizing slow death. And if you read around, I'm not the only one with this problem. Yes, it keeps your computer safer. Yes, it cleans up space on your hard drive. Because it does what it says it will do, I'm giving it 2 stars instead of just 1. I've had Norton Antivirus installed before and never had these problems."
4,This CD is great for people new to ASL or have little knowledge with sign language. The fact that you can watch the signs being performed at the same time you can read the text is awesome. Great CD for the price.
5,"This is the easiest backup program that I have ever used. If you are looking for the best solution for backups, this product is for you. Highly Recommended!"
2,"This review isn't for Office 365 itself, but rather for the University 4yr Academic Key Card version, which requires student validation.<br /><br />I am a student who has used previous student versions of Microsoft Office. Therefore, I did not expect any issues with validating this product when I ordered it; however, I personally found the student validation process so frustrating, I stopped trying to install Office 365 and just started exporting Google Docs into Word format and turning in my assignments that way.<br /><br />Since Microsoft is discounting this product for those in school, I can fully understand the need to verify that people who buy it are actually students. However, the verification process shouldn't feel like a waste of time and it shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes. As a student, I've purchased several software packages under an academic discount and this is the only one I've given up on. I think Microsoft should take a cue from Adobe and Apple and make their student software more accessible."
3,"I've used TurboTax to do my taxes for many years, in some years I used TaxCut (or whatever it's called now). I've generally found TT to be slightly better, but not dramatically so, and therefore have in the past recommended that buyers consider price as an important factor in the decision.<br /><br />This year I'm in the position of being able to compare the Deluxe & Premier versions, and so far can comment in detail on the investment-related features, which is where they differ.<br /><br />But first: if you're not familiar with TurboTax -- it really is a good option for preparing your taxes if you are a do-it-yourself person, comfortable with going to the IRS website or other tax info sources to get answers to questions. No, TT will NOT, despite the grand marketing claims, take care of you if you're not quite sure about the rules or are confused about some little tax detail that's not either simple or common.<br /><br />If you aren't very comfortable with figuring out the rules, then you might want to have a tax advisor available who can answer questions and perhaps also review your return before you submit it.<br /><br />Now to this year's program: it mostly looks the same as last year's, and the basic workflow seemed familiar and easy to follow. I do like the fact that you can either follow the easy guided path (EasyGuide) or navigate on your own. The dowload options for W2s and 1099s are comprehensive (you can find lists on the Intuit website), but note that Paychex is apparently (still) not supported.<br /><br />1. If you have tax-exempt dividends from a multi-state muni fund, TT doesn't allow to enter the fraction or amount of the dividend that's from your state (so tax-exempt in your state return). They want you to split the 1099 into two parts, one for your state and one for the others. This is just DUMB. A product that generates $1.5 billion in revenue deserves a bit more care & attention.<br /><br />2. This year you'll start seeing the complexity that the IRS created with the basis reporting on sales of stocks and mutual funds. The problem is that some sales are \\""covered\\"", meaning that the basis has to be reported to the IRS (using your chosen basis method), and others are reported as sales, but basis is your job. I found that sorting through this stuff is mind-bending and error-prone, to a large extent because of the shockingly poor job TurboTax does at helping you work through this. A simple table-type structure where you could quickly enter, review, and correct all the transaction data isn't hard to imagine. But imagine is all you can do because of the horrible interface you'll get in TT. I even went into the Forms interfaces, looking at the imported 1099B and the 8949 and the Cap Gains Worksheet -- unfortunately it's even harder to work with those.<br /><br />3. If you have investment transactions, you should probably cough up the extra money and get the Premier version. With the Deluxe version the security names & transaction descriptions are not downloaded correctly: For example, \\""1000 shares of XYZ\\"" shows up as \\""EXCH to ABC\\"" in my case with a 1099B. (Being cynical, I'm thinking that this is an intentional feature degrade, to \\""persuade\\"" us to buy Premier.) With a 1099Div, the payer name was simply \\""Vanguard\\"", instead of the name of the fund, which is not ideal because you want the name on the return to match the name on the report going to the IRS.<br /><br />That's all I have for now, I'll try to write an update when I'm done with my taxes. Hope this helps!<br /><br />Note (Jan 27):<br />I found another area where TT doesn't handle things well, but it's likely to be quite rare: I have a foreign bank account, which earned interest. I couldn't find an obvious place to enter (foreign) interest not reported on a 1099, so entered it in the 1099 workflow, filling in the required details. I had already generated a Form 1116 because of mutual fund foreign income. However, TT did not add the new data to the existing 1116, or generate a new one.. It only flagged this during the error check, and essentially said \\""you made a mistake, go do the form\\"". Not what I expected.<br /><br />Note (Feb 16):<br />Another funny thing: I downloaded Vanguard brokerage 1099, and it seems that only the first sale (capgain) transaction was imported. I can't tell easily whether this is a Vanguard glitch or a TT glitch. Either way, watch out for stuff like this seems to be the appropriate conclusion.w data to the existing 1116, or generate a new one..

2,"i did my homework, read the reviews and happily went purchase the sony vegas movie maker + dvd. They are very nice features as advertised, and its priced great, thats the only reason i gave it any stars, but it is NOT user friendly. The manual is haphazzard and disorganized and the show me how feature is great if you already know what you want to do and what its called in this software, otherwise you're basically randomly pushing buttons. Which I dont mind personally, i like experimenting with software, but I never could get the program to capture audio. It will record audio, but my doing a voice over of \\""this is my baby saying her first word\\"" is not quite the same as actually hearing her on the video. NO help from sony, I emailed 3 days ago with only a form reply saying we got your email and will reply as soon as we can, and the phone service, you have to pay for...up to and beyond the amount of service, no thanks. This time I think I'll listen to cnet rather than user reviews and return this and pick up the pinnacle. Even if it crashes or freezes, Im not getting anywhere anyway."
2,This destroyed my computer. I do not know if it was just my computer's time to go but once I installed this nothing worked the same way again. My computer was fine once I uninstalled it.
5,When everthing works just the way it should online buying is a breeze. This is a great product that works as intended.
4,I installed Windows 7 on my Mac using a Bootcamp partition. Now I can get more utility out of it.
4,"I like my Pinnacle but it can be frustrating at times. I just had to learn some patience and take it slow. Let it do it's thing before you move on clicking away. I got lucky when my computer had a meltdown and I lost everything. I had a DVD of some of my work to see how it looked on the TV. It was only 11 minutes long and had several video clips with music and some transitions. I imported it from my file menu and used it as I continued working on my project. I re-rendered this project and it rendered very fast since all the parts of the this segment had already been pre-rendered. This gave me the idea to make my full movies with several DVD's like \\""Acts\\"" in a play. I make a few minutes of my show with all the bells and whistles i want and then render that segment on a DVD R/W and do this until my show is finished. My Dad's Vietnam documentary was broke up into 6 different DVD's. I then import all of them and drag and drop them into my timeline and render the entire movie on one single DVD. If any small glitches exist i fix them but keep that to a dull roar! the whole idea is to keep the overall work load down to a minimum - like re-tracking some music or adding a transition etc... and then I render the entire project. My first disk on the documentary is 59 minutes long with lots of music, tons of video i took on my panasonic mini DV with a lot of transitions and effects. Since all of the segments of my disk were all PRE-RENDERED the whole project rendered very fast and did not CRASH!!! and this has worked on other projects for me as well. I have a Sony Vaio computer with Windows XP Home Edition Ver. 2002 with a Pentium 4 CPU 3.06 GHz - 1 Gig of RAM and 200 GB of Drive D space.I hope this helps others on their projects and good luck movie making."
1,"Difficult to get support service. After repeated attempts I have been unable to get any response through their support ticket service or customer service email. Other comments confirm that the program has a tendency to crash and that they fail to respond. If you 're creating a home inventory for insurance and similar purposes, and the the program crashes as this one does, then you will not have the information you need when required."
3,"Has anyone who has purchased this new version of this software used the Rental Property Manager feature yet? I have an early version (2.0), and would like to know if this new version of Quicken can import the existing data files I have. Version 10 could not. The reviews so far are light on details. Please report your experience with the rental manager section of the product. Thanks!"
1,"I wasted $70 hoping find a simple color filter to put over my pictures. This program has no color filter, no ease of use--all it functions are not right at its surface for total freedom to use right away: Every button you need to use has to be learned--and its particular location discovered, sometimes--by learning where the designer has hid away...Buddy: Anything you need on this program should be on its desktop window, just a cursor move and one click away: all these extra odd, hidden steps just to get the button to you need are deliberate programming hacks designed to cheat the cheaper program of its chance to do the job well enough to say, \\""Job done!\\"" They want you to check in to whether Adobe's $200+ program--3X as expensive as this program--offers the hope you're looking for: paying Adobe more money to make its designers do a more considerate job meeting the customer's expectations: well, it's 2012, Folks, and simple picture editing Apps for tablet-like desktop layer app-button point-and-click accessibility are out there--so we can just forget about caring whether Adobe's designers care whether they are doing a better job with their programs, or not: the old Adobe CD-Rom era is dead! This Adobe program did not put the buttons on the desktop surface layer where we expect them!--So, don't buy it! Don't even bother with a try: These buttons need a desktop fix-it feature--total re-arragiblility of its buttons, so its buttons can be put up on the desktop layer where they belong: all in one place like a tablet does with it's Apps--Adobe's designers should have known make them movable there already--since Apple's I-Pad has been able to do this since mid 2010: I phones and the I Pad have had rotating carousel surfaces since then--if Adobe needed a desktop surface layer with more space.... Adobe also frustrated this product's usability by putting obscure symbols on the buttons: super-snazzy photo technician noise that just confuses the customer who hoped he would instantly know what to do with the program--just with one look--this Adobe's program can't let you re-name these buttons with regular words, so each time the customer goes back to this software, the memory of the user has to do the work of rediscovering how these strangely-symboled buttons worked last time they were used... These experiences with the product are enough to reject it and they are clearly designed to be part of it to get the disappointed customer to want to dump the cheap program for the next level program up in price--Once Adobe suckers you into buying this cheap one: you'll be on the treadmill for guessing if the next more expensive photo-editing program has all the expected feature for 3X the price!--where a reasoning man is hoping for at least 1/3 the defects, after paying 3X as much! But People, these problems are more easily corrected by spending $0 on Adobe!--that's right: Zero Money! Because Microsoft's picture editing interfaces are simpler and get the regular job done with a more pleasant blue-and-white interface--Adobe's interface is all dark grey and black and just an ugly interface to put you off. Adobe doesn't let you fix the problem by giving you the use color-freedom settings: Why? Because freedom with assignability, naming, or color selection lets you tailor all the machines in the world for a simple intelligent interface everybody wants! Allowing the use Adobe's software not just for a trivial picture editing tasks, but for how to come up with the perfect photo editing App: did Instagram just make a Billion dollars? So, the one who copyrights what he gets to try from an ideal Adobe program with button assignability, naming, and color selection customers makes Adobe jealous. The simple remedy to all this in 2012 is to just ignore Adobe altogether! Go straight to the web/internet/cloud: just try the more intuitive picture editing programs: try Picnic or Instagram--use your right to buy-and-try--it's cheaper there and relatively risk free: skip off-line picture editing for your laptop: don't waste your money on an off-line program like this Adobe--you're just paying an Adobe programmer all over again to do what a Microsoft programmer was told to do: keep the good features off the less expensive CD-ROM: Adobe and Microsoft still live in the CD-ROM age...offering to pay a programmer at Adobe to do what a programmer at Microsoft was supposed to do--all over again--won't be getting Adobe to be filling in any of the deficits the Microsoft programmer left intentionally at his bosses command...Adobe does just like Microsoft-->it works towards the next sale this way: Adobe uses a harsh and restrictive policy on your freedom to buy-and-try--that customer right that almost every business everywhere respects: because customers help business get rid of competitors this way--Adobe's \\""Buddy, if you try it: you buy it!\\"" policy is not the way Adobe should talk to a potential money source...but Adobe's arrogance comes from knowing it has trained and conditioned customers to respect the idea that the customer can't ever open the box: Adobe uses this technicality to bring up another topic: the accusation you copied it!--which Adobe uses as an excuse to keep your money: Quite simply, Adobe should make their software un-copiable, and prosecutible by putting identifying marks in the program to stop anybody from copying it: but the real reason you can't buy-and-try it is: were you to try it, you wouldn't even want a copy of it!--it's junk you'd just want to take it back to get your money back!! This Adobe rip-deal hoping for a dumb package-opening decision is just a check-out counter roach motel: your dollars check in, but they don't check out!--once you take it home and open it, this inferior product is yours: This is sharp-practice software sales, which aims to hard-scam customer money under $100 bucks--Rich companies like Adobe assess fools to be able to take a hit for $100 bucks or less!: figuring fools will be back again to see if giving Adobe 3X the money = Adobe will put only 1/3 the design flaws in this time, again--and proving the gullible customer is now ready to accept a $200+ hit--and still have appetitie for more story of this type, for a return for some more sucker bait: Maybe the $500 program has all the stuff!...don't let them put you on this treadmill of gullibility abuse: Use buy-and-try today on the internet before you buy a CD-ROM: 2012 App programs put these boxed CD-ROM programs to shame--in a 'behind-the-times' category. Cloud-hosted App providers keep upgrading Apps all the time: a better bet to put your money here..."
1,"I have used Norton products for 20 years and may never buy another. This is if possible a bigger piece of trash than Systemworks 2007. It edges out Systemworks because after the install of Internet Security 2007, Liveupdate is added to the list of features that no longer work, making it impossible to get future fixes to the bugs in both products!"
1,"Question,<br /><br />I read all these complaints about the company and the software. Why does Amazon still let this company sell products through the Amazon Marketplace with so many angry customers? Also, the product KeyGrabber USB KeyLogger 8MB Black is a piece of junk and does not work. If and when it does work, it does not capture the data from the keyboard that you need. Many online banking sites somehow block this device from capturing anything. I checked with my bank, I was told because of the way the site is coded, the device will not work. Since IE9 does not save my username and password either, everything on the market for this industry is dead. With so much technology out, it is really amazing the United States has no more people / programmers / developers / computer engineers with any brains left."
3,"I recently downloaded this as a trial program from Nikon and Adobe lightroom 2. Recently I have been spending more time shooting photos and wanted a program to do adjustments. Photoshop is out of the question for me as a hobbyist, so I looked to these programs based on different magazine, and website recommendations. NX2 is a very solid piece of software, it does what a photographer needs to do, if you are into design than you need Photoshop. I really feel like Nikon designed this for the everyday photographer to the serious hobbyist. The interface is a bit different if you have used other programs in the past, but many of the shortcuts are close to other ones, that it should not take you long to get up and running. In comparing this with Lightroom, both offer very similar features,and it really depends on your flavor. Like other reviewers have stated, you can get a free trial from Nikon for 60 days, so get it and play around with it."
4,"I went ahead and bought this program based on the reviews and its price. I must say that if you have used any other CAD program or the Visio building stencils, this will be an easy program to learn. I opened the my first drawing and started putting together my new house right away.<br />Creating the rooms were very simple. There were a few times I had to search for an answer (like how to use a jogged wall to create an entry way), but for the most part it was pretty simple.<br />The main gripe I have with this program is the lack of objects. One area that is totally missing is electrical. You can place where lights belong in the house, but there is no objects for electrical outlets, light switches, phone jacks, or cable/Internet connections. I was surprised because I consider these to be major features.<br />The other issue I have with the program is that when you print your layout there is alot of whitespace surrounding your drawing. If you try to increase the image size then your drawing gets placed on multiple pages.<br />Other than these issues I think the program is great. If you are looking for an easy to learn program that will give you the ability to layout your furniture, this program is for you."
5,"The new interface makes it easier to work around the programs, and the Contact Manager addition to my Microsoft Outlook has proven worth the money. I will recommended for a Small Business User that wants to be more organized and have the tools to prove it."

4,"If you are a mid-sized company that can afford a &#34;multi-user version&#34; with &#34;support plan&#34; then Sage 50 is excellent software. But the &#34;mom and pop shop&#34; watching every dime they spend is out of luck with the newer versions of Sage 50. For them I recommend going on ebay or amazon and getting an older version (before 2013) so that they can do their accounting and payroll forever without buying new software every year. Don't blame the Sage company. They are faced with the realities of the software business. There is no longer any money in selling a program that can be used forever without updating. Oh...and whatever you do...stay away from Quick books which has many technical problems in its database and is organized in the most confusing, illogical way."

I already know i am watching a backup. I have tried to change the actual VOB file in the temp directory to a THX trailer and when you mess with the files, the program will error and shut down.<BR>I say 4 stars because of it's ease of use, if they would let me configure it the way i wanted and put what i want on the DVD then by all means it would get 5 stars!!!!!"
5,"This is a briliant game. The graphics are superb, the sound is very good, the control excelent and the gameplay very exciting. It compares with Mario64 only you are not collecting stars but dark souls, 120 of them, in a huge envirionment, solving puzzles on the way and have a battle or 200 with mass murderers, ghosts and other freaky customers as well. Not for the young but a must for teenagers and adults who like dark comics."
5,"I love Turbo Tax ,its saved me about $400.00 compared to the last tax consultant I had and does the same job. If you have any questions they are answered within a day (usually) by the Turbo Tax community. I purchased this on Amazon for 39.99 and ya can&#34;t beat that."

5,The best software over the years.<br />Very thorough !
1,could not finish. same error as what others are getting. Dev's need to repair patch.
5,"This is a great backup software program. There is a reason it's highly rated - it's name \\""True Image\\"" says it all. The only heads up I feel compelled to share is - read the users manual for set up and a complete understanding of \\""How to\\"" and \\""What to\\"" backup. It's all there - every step. It's up to you whether or not to use \\""Cloud Storage\\"" (dependent upon the product you purchase) and/or local storage (backup drive). Acronis doesn't force you to use the \\""Cloud\\"" as many companies are these days. You have the exact same backup functionality either way. Once you've completed your set up, Acronis takes over. It's just that easy."

5,I bought the 2011 Streets and Maps for my wife to use at work. She is a school bus dispatcher for an elementary school district in California. She assigns kids to school buses for the various schools in the district based on their residence address. The district's info technology department has failed to update the district residence map for at least 5 years. Using the old maps a number of students residences could not be located. My wife says that the new Streets and Maps software is working beautifully. Every residence address she has searched for has been found. This makes bus and school assignments much easier. A lot of stress has been eliminated. Thank you Microsoft for the 2011 Streets and Maps software. Thank you Amazon for selling this software.

2,Overwhelmed my computer. Did a great job and stop the unwanted and stop everything else.

It's fairly intuitive to use and shines when it comes to its speed.<br /><br />Version 12 works with Windows 8 and is also compatible with tablets. I'm not sure that professionals would find the software robust enough for their purposes, but it's above and beyond what a casual user or enthusiast would need."

5,"Easy to install and set up. Dashboard makes things simple and easy from adding hard drives to moving folder locations.<br />One thing to know, some routers won't play nice when trying to connect a pc. This is no fault of WHS, it's all the router. My D-Link required me to manually find the server through Network rather than letting the system find it, download the set-up, and then make a direct connection between WHS and pc and run the set-up. I was able to put the router back in the loop afterwards. Probably other ways around it, but this was the quickest I could think of at the time that worked."

However, If you want to know your taxes are done correctly and you want to avoid paying an accountant to do the work, this gets the job done quickly.

But the disc was useless on two modern machines running Vista and Win7. So, I had to download the product to both of my machines anyway. Nice way to get off on the wrong foot with this consumer. Too soon to report on usability and effectiveness."
1,"We tried to use this product, bought a 3 license package, we are a small sales company. The product became Unusable. We have 3 fairly new Dell computers, all with pentium 3 or 4 and the system slowed to a point where you could not tolerate it. The Sync by email feature which we liked is gone. You have to open a port in order to sync now. The amount of work that would have been required to figure this out not worth it. Next upgrade may be GoldMind."

But .... after installation, I noticed that boot-up time doubled, as well as shut down. Getting on the computer is now very sloooooooow. Frustrating. Ad-Aware was never like this. So, be forewarned. If Zone Labs could fix this resource-hog issue, the product would easily make 5 stars. Four stars is toward the quality of protection only."
3,"I purchased after talking w/ H&R Block about e-filing VA PTE-502 State (Sub-S) returns. Come to find out. The product fills out the VA forms but does not e-file them. H&R Block has offered to allow me to get my $ back. I will if I don't use the product for my personal taxes. I ended up purchasing TaxAct to do my Corp. Sub-S forms, it does e-file VA PTE-502.<br />Functioning of the SW is OK. There's a few places where it could do better. I had to hand prepare .doc files of some attached schedules. The SW did a good job preparing the schedules, but the font was to small to read. (and to further complicate the issue, the font was fine the 1st time it printed the 'attached schedules', but got too small thereafter.) I called about this problem, but the fairly knowledgeable help personnel couldn't explain it."

4,"I am impressed by the features of this new version, but somewhat dismayed at the learning curve to find commands that had been instinctive. I believe that people who are using Office for the first time or are not that familiar with the earlier Office will find this version easier to learn. We old dogs will just have to adapt. I might add that the Professional version contains a lot of programs that are excellent, but I only use about half of them. A new buyer might consider a less expensive version."

3,"I purchased the Printshop Deluxe 3.5 to replace The Printshop Deluxe 15 (2002) in hopes for a more modern, more full featured product and to be honest, I personally was happier with the older version. I'm sure there's more that you can do with the version 3.5, but I just preferred the interface of the older version. With the older version, the installation involved 4 disks (including 2 art disks) placing everything on your hard drive for fast access. The newer version (3.5) just wasn't as easy for me to use. I'm back to using the Printshop Deluxe 15 (2002). I'm not saying version 3.5 isn't a good product, I just prefer the older version."
3,So far Norton 360 version 5.0 has been pretty good. This particular one allows you to load it on 3 different PCs. When I initially installed it on two different PCs it really messed them up. My CD-ROM drive (D:) disappeared on each one and I ended up having to fully restore them. After much distress I finally got them working. I've read multiple forums and other users have all kinds of issues with their equipment due to Norton 360. I have since upgraded to version 6.0 without any problems. The product did arrive on time and was exactly as described by the seller. My 3-star rating is due to the product performance.
1,"I bought PDF Pro 6.0 (3 licenses!) a month before they came out with 7.0 and you know what they did? They dropped me like a hot potato. 6.0 was full of bugs that continue to plague me, but Nuance doesn't care. The offered me a VERY EXPENSIVE upgrade path, something like 30% off the retail cost of 7.0, something they offer ALL past customers. Never mind that they just orphaned me and essentially committed fraud by letting me buy three licenses of a piece of crap software that they were about to orphan within a month, without informing me.<br /><br />Don't buy PDF Creator 7.0. They'll find some way to screw you.<br /><br />- Their activation system is broken and nags you for activations every few days. This has been going on for years over several versions, and they DON'T CARE.<br /><br />- Their software is buggy, and they're very slow to fix bugs, and the ones they fix are irrelevant to core functions that are STILL BROKEN.<br /><br />- If you have any graphics, their software creates PDFs that are 5X larger than Adobe.<br /><br />- All they do is find new ways of MILKING MONEY OUT OF YOU.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is the best PDF software out there, so if you get it, bend over and be prepared to be screwed."
5,Very excellent item.
1,"I've been using Print Shop for years and found it easy to use....but now with The Print Shop 3.5, it really sucks as far as I'm concerned!! It is awast of my time, start up is BAD, totally new .. for who not one thing is good. I really haven't found one thing I like about this program!! For example,to do a headline on any doc, you could easily type in the words and it was done....now one has to find this stupid little box up in the top of the screen and type in the words....I'm sure there are a thousands of other examples I could use. Another problem I've found in just the few times I've tried to use this masterpiece of uselessness, is 3.5 will not allow me to make changes to several previous projects I've done. I'm happy I still have my laptop with Print Shop 23.Pro!! I would never recommend anyone to purchase this terrible program. it is really that BAD........."

I tried downloading from the Trend Micro site, and my bank locked up my card (For fraud alert reasons).

These days you have to be careful."
2,"I admit it... I was happy with Windows 98 but then someone stole our computer. The replacement came with Windows XP motto \\""we think you want things this way, so don't try to do what you want, we know best\\"". If you're a newby you might be happy with this approach, but XP has sucked up hours of time trying to be whipped into line so that it does what I want, in the way that I want it.<br />For example: <BR>- it's incompatible with ZoneAlarm firewall. Every time Windows updates, Outlook Express permissions on ZoneAlarm have to be reconfigured or you don't get email. 98 didn't have this problem.<BR>- useful programs that I use on my Start Menu disappear if I don't use them. So items used (say) monthly have to be hunted down, requiring more mouse clicks. This is an irritating functionality.<BR>- the Help function is crippled by comparison to 98, unless you are willing to go onto the internet. With phone-line dial-in, this is irritating.<BR>- there is little guidance on setting up Identities for a new user of identities, and some programs will register and operate under some identities but not under others (unless you buy two copies of the program). This means more mouse clicks, or duplicate configuration.<BR>- it assumes you want all of microsoft's products to operate for you. In truth I want Word and Excel to never ever go on the internet, and I never want HTML or Word files to be my basic email mode. <BR>- it assumes that only Windows Media Player is the soundware of choice.<BR>- it takes a long time to close down, to the point where you assume it has failed to shut down. Advice: don't CTRL ALT DEL. Just wait even longer.<br />Those are the negatives. In sum, XP behaves like a giant bundled amorphous mass, and trying to configure to prevent certain chunks from behaving in an aggressive fashion will take you much time and effort.<br />However it is relatively stable compared with Windows 98, and most of the configuration can be achieved in time. <br />On thesegrounds, and given that 98 is no longer supported, it can be recommended. <br />Martin"

5,"I guess I could wait until I use this specific item before rating which I usually do. In this case I have used Turbo tax for over ten years now and have been greatly satisfied with this product. I remember years and years of filling out paper forms, checking and double checking math and instruction references to assure everything is correct each year with frequent changes to the law. I do taxes for myself and 4 or 5 relatives. The import function of previous years information is effortless which takes the effort of manually tracking and moving data forward. The icing on the cake is 5 free electronic filings available with one purchase. I do not have a formal business, but two of the returns I prepare have multiple rental properties which the premier version handles perfectly."
4,"Look at the reviews and you'll find that those who gave this product a poor rating have never used the most recent addition. I really don't care what someone may think about an old product because it has nothing to do with THIS product. One reviewer ever calls it \\""KTC\\""... sorry but they have not used the name Kiplinger's since the 2000 version.<br /><br />Get a clue.<br /><br />THIS product does as good a job as any, is easy to follow, imports Quicken data just fine (if you have it set up correctly to begin with), has the features that mean the most and does it as a cost far less than TurboTax."
5,Grandson loves this game. He had an older version and wanted the new one.<br />He loves what it does and uses it often. It is a game with lessons and that is<br />one of the best things about this game.
4,"I bought this product in January 2014. I like this product because of how easy it was to install, plus it was on sale, and way cheaper than what Mcafee was charging on their website. It is not a CD, it is a product key, but I am ok with this. I was a bit hesitant at first, but it worked out"
5,"So to start, I went into this very expecting, and despite the reviews, i was not let down. Yes, it took me some getting used to, not having Start menu. But when i recently realized that you can group your icons in Metro, and name them, the &#34;organization freak&#34; inside of me exploded. I have been using it much more now. As i have 3 monitors and utilize eyefinity, its beautiful and looks great going across all 3. Also, with multiple monitors, it is much improved, and have much more compatibility. My only complaints are Driver issues. My saitek gaming keyboard refuses to work(saitek's fault, mainly, as they are taking forever in releasing a driver compatible). Also, Punkbuster is taking FOREVER, and i cant play a few games. Overall, well worth it!(:"
3,"According to OnePriceTaxes customer support, this software will only allow one return for the OnePrice. If you want to prepare returns for your children or parents you will have to pay again for each return. Also, it does not give you the option of filing on paper, only e-File. Pretty basic and not very versatile."
5,"I was using QuickBooks Pro 2003 and my husband bought me a new computer for Christmas with Windows 8. I wanted to retrieve my QB companies from the old computer. Well, this program allowed me to retrieve all my info from the old computer and open up all my companies on the new computer!! Very happy I was able to do this. The accessing different areas of the program are a little different, but that usually happens when there is an upgrade. I am able to work in it just fine."
5,WORKS VERY WELL
3,"I have been using image database programs for quite some time. Since Taos Image finder was new it perked my interest.I will admit that the GUI is very pleasing and if you have a newer high quality video card you will be impressed with the programs abilty to display and adjust pictures in real time. One area where the program falls short however is in search ability. I was not able to consistantly have the program find what it should doing various searches of an 8,000 picture plus database. This included searches on file size, file name, and hotword entries which had been made prior to the searches. Using two other programs of the same type and the same picture collection produced perfect results each time. In my opinion this program shows much promise. If the internal database and search engines are improved it would truley be a class \\""A\\"" piece of software.I look forward to future releases to see how this application progresses."
2,"I bought the 2003 version for my son last week. It effectively blocks sites in the selected categories, but also blocks some benign sites even if I specify them to always be 'trusted sites'. The only way to get to these sites is to remove ALL restrictions, which defeats the purpose of the product. I had to uninstall and reinstall after W98 starting giving me a startup error msg which suggested that content Barrier wasn't loading. Email to Intego tech support has not been answered. Calling them only lets you leave a voice mail. Can't seem talk to a human. Sorry I bought it."
5,I would recommend System Mechanic for every computer. It's easy to install and use. Has many individual and automatic features to keep your computer running smooth and efficient. I love this product!
5,"I love the fact that this is the BEST antivirus in the world, it's quick on the scan, fast loading, and easy to use. A must have."
4,"I've used Family Tree Maker for many years now, as well as ancestry.com. If you find that ancestry.com is a bit cumbersome at times, you should give the software a try. Family Tree Maker isn't a fully polished software application, but it does get the job done and when it comes genealogy it's one of the few choices to complete the job. Deciding between the various versions of Family Tree Maker should be fairly simple as there are few noticeable differences. Every year or two I will buy the newest version simply to get the ancestry.com membership that is included with the software.<br /><br />The Essentials version gives you 1 month of ancestry.com access, the Deluxe gives 3 months and the Platinum 6 months. The platinum also includes some photo software and an additional gift copy, but those are the differences worth noting in my opinion. Using ancestry.com is much more interactive and it has a cleaner interface, but the FTM software provides better importing and exporting features. I tend to find myself working much faster in FTM than I do online.<br /><br />Is the 2012 version worth an upgrade from previous versions? Like I said, I often upgrade simply for the ancestry.com membership that is included. New to 2012 is the Tree Sync, but it wasn't super impressive. They have also improved some of the guides/tutorials and editing options. Overall, the interface has gotten cleaner, but I still the only true reason for an immediate upgrade is for the membership when you need it."
5,"Serif is a great company to do business with. They work with their customers and try to find a solution to any problem that might occur. Thanks Serif, a pleasure doing business with you."
4,Have not had much experience with it yet. But I am satisfied so far.
5,Very pleased with the shipping time. Product received was brand new just as described.
5,I had to upgrade to Peachtree 2010 because I got a new computer with Windows 7. Found this on Amazon - great price! Thank you
4,not frequently used. a little difficult to get it on computer
5,We have used Turbo Tax for at least 8 years now and we are happy with it every time. I love how it transfers the last years data. I think we actually completed this year return (including many itemizations) in about 20 minutes. We got our federal and state filed and returns back in about 5 days times. I cant ask for a better product.
3,no comment
5,"I just got this and just loaded but I have already found that it was worth the money by playing just one game so far and that game is Sky Taxi. If you love playing with your Wii, PS3, Nintendo DS (I have all. Spoiled I know but hey I am 55, retired and can afford my game habit) and enjoy games like Mario and Sly Cooper then you will like Sky Taxi. This is the first time that I have stumbled on a pc game play format like Mario or Sly Cooper. I had to get used of using the mouse but hey I did it. I just starting playing the Pied Piper and a little different hidden object game but I will adjust, always do. Challenges keep my old brain sharp remember that you young things reading this."
5,I have used Digital Juice for PowerPoint at our church for backgrounds for many of the songs that we project on a large screen. We find this to be a very high resolution product with consistently good quality throughout.
5,I have been using Turbo Tax for a number of years. It handles my tax forms and K-1's with ease. I strongly recommend this product to everyone.
5,"I just bought Dragon NaturallySpeaking and I've already had a lot of success with it. If you're considering this product, I'd highly recommend it. Initially, I bought it because I'm a lawyer and do a lot of dictating anyway. But I also like to see the words on the screen, which is why I sometimes prefer to type things myself. I figured that Dragon NaturallySpeaking would be the best of both worlds. So far, it's worked pretty well for me. But keep in mind that the software doesn't work perfectly right out of the box. Based on my brief experience with the product, there are several keys to success. <br />The first is to put in the time doing the voice-recognition training. Unless you teach the software to recognize your voice, it just won't work correctly. There's simply no getting around this. Although it may seem tedious at first, the training will pay off. (Besides, some of the training exercises on the software are very entertaining. For example, you can read President Kennedy's inspiring inaugural address or an excerpt from \\""Dogbert's Top Secret Management Handbook.\\"") I spent at least an hour or two training the software when it first arrived and, believe me, it was time well spent. After the initial training period, the more you use it the better it gets because it is constantly \\""learning\\"" from its mistakes. As another reviewer has suggested, it probably takes about two months before you'll be really impressed with the product's potential. (But I'm pretty impressed after only a few weeks!)<br />The second is to buy a decent microphone. A lot of reviewers recommend a USB microphone, but an expensive USB model probably isn't necessary. I have an analog microphone (a Plantronics .Audio 90) and it works just fine. This particular model was far less expensive than most USB microphones that I've seen. The key is to find one that will allow you to position the microphone correctly in relation to your mouth. As the instructions tell you, the positioning of the microphone is essential. Frankly, the one that was included with the software just wasn't up to the task. It always seemed to be too close to my mouth and I was getting very poor results. But as soon as I started using the Plantronics, the accuracy of the software improved dramatically. Trust me, you'll be a a lot happier with the software if you spend a few extra bucks on a good microphone.<br />Third, although it may seem counterintuitive, you should always speak quickly and naturally when dictating, rather than one word at a time. For some reason, the software is far more accurate when you do. Of course, this is a two-edged sword. If you're really \\""on a roll,\\"" and speaking quickly, the software is very accurate. On the other hand, when you just want to insert a word here or there, it really isn't. Consequently, I find that you still have to do some mouse movements when editing your documents. So, although Dragon NaturallySpeaking promises virtually hands-free operation of your computer, don't expect miracles, at least not at first.<br />Finally, until you really start to master the product, you should probably use the text editor that's included with the software. It's called \\""DragonPad,\\"" and I've found that the voice recognition is somewhat more accurate when used with this program than it is with, say, Word or Outlook. Don't ask me why. Besides, it's really not that much of a bother. You can simply cut and paste from DragonPad into whatever application you may be using. When you first start using Dragon NaturallySpeaking, the increased accuracy is worth the extra step. You tend to get less frustrated when it's working the way it's supposed to.<br />I hope these tips help. Have fun, and remember that practice makes perfect. (Yes, this review was dictated using Dragon NaturallySpeaking.)"
4,"The software works perfectly as stated. I had to watch the [...] video how to edit, and I was able to figure it out. The program has powerful editing features. The new version 17 Pro is suppose be even better."
3,"It is fun, but I really expected it to be like some of their other games. The challenges are not that challenging. Some games are childish."
1,"This is awful. I got a horrible worm with it! With the avast that's free, I've never even gotten a worm. Some protection. This is garbage. I wish I could give it no stars. I lost so much information."
1,"Tried the trial version & liked it. Especially liked the interface & the ability to add music easily. More importantly, it worked, so I bought the retail version. After spending upwards of 50 hours and a dozen emails to tech support trying to get the retail version to work, I've given up. Burned DVD video quality is extremely poor and, more recently, I can't even get it to import video from my camcorder. Email tech support is curteous, but absolutely usless. Most recently they wanted me to send them a screen shot of a 6 character windows error message that pops up when trying to import video (google \\""PDR.exe\\"" and the first entry will be complaints about this product). I decided my time would be better spent trying to warn other folks about the flaws of PowerDirector. If you're still considering buying this product, please take a few minutes to review comments from other dissapointed customers that are posted on the web. Unless you've got dozens of hours to waste and enjoy throwing away $, I'd suggest that you steer clear of PowerDirector."
5,Read Cpt_Kirk's review a few reviews down. It tells you everything you need to know. Forget about DEMO Linux. Install a full size free distro instead. Read the review.
5,Works well.
5,I bought this as my son's elementary school uses it in computer class. It is marvelous for kids and adults as well!
5,"I really recommended anyone to use this English Pronunciation program! It is very helpful. The owner &#34;Xin&#34; is really good customer services, great consul and help me to resolve the program when I don't know how to use it. Thank you very much Xin!! Excellent job :-)"
2,"This product is, at best, just o.k. the hairstyles were average. Some reminded me of the 80's. the good thing though, was that your could vary the hair color alot so at leat you could get an idea of what you might like. There are about 3 cds that have to be installed. Also, the makeup cd is a WASTE OF TIME. It offers drawn lips that you paste on your face! I dont know about the people that made this program but, i think its awful. If your thinking of buying this product I suggest you think twice."
4,"I had no intention of purchasing Family Tree Maker 2009 since I was happy with the FTM 16 version I was using. However, when I became aware that it included a free six-month subscription to Ancestry.com when I was currently paying $29.95 per month for that access, the purchase became a no-brainer. [...]. Wrong! When I called to activate the free subscription, I learned that it is only a free six-month subscription to the US Membership Option. To upgrade that \\""free\\"" subscription to the World Edition I need requires me to pay $10 per month for the six-month period. So, I still save $32.21 but nowhere on this site does it say that the free subscription is only to the US option. Nor does it say that on the product box. In fact, the box clearly states that \\""Family Tree Maker Deluxe 2009 comes with six months of free access to Ancestry.com, the world's largest online collection of family history resources\\"". I would still recommend the product. I didn't like it at first because it seemed difficult to navigate. But, extensive usage soon let me gain familiarity and the improvements are substantial. It is definitely an industrial-strength genealogy program with features that are quite advanced when compared to the FTM 16 version I was using. The only area in which I would downgrade it is that report generation is too slow and takes far longer when compared to generating reports with my prior version. I've also noticed some character conversion problems that I'm assuming will be fixed with a version update. My main point, though, is that potential purchasers should be aware that the free six-months of free access is to US records only. World access will require you to pay $10 per month during that six-month period. It should not be that complicated to make that point clear in marketing materials."
1,"When I loaded my brand new full version of Windows 7 Home Premium on my brand new Apple iMac (using Boot Camp to partition the drive), the product code did not work. I went on line and found that a lot of other people are having the same problem, but I could not find a solution. Microsoft's help site offered the following explanation for my problem: (1) I didn't enter the code correctly, (2) I was using counterfeit software; or (3) I was trying to use the same software on two different PCs and should buy a new license. IOW, I am either a moron or a thief. So with heavy heart, I sought help from Microsoft by telephone. After spending two days in Microsoft hell talking to reps around the world, I learned that, although the disc and box it came in were labeled \\""Home Premium,\\"" the disc contained Home Basic. Microsoft's proposed solution was to give me a Windows 7 Home Basic product code for me to load Home Basic on my PC and then I could BUY an update to Home Premium. Not a very good solution for a problem that was entirely Microsoft's fault, but I was unwilling to invest any more time or frustration dealing with Microsoft customer service. At one point, a rep had the nerve to tell me that I should not have bought the product from Amazon because it deals in counterfeit goods. Luckily, Amazon actually has a functioning customer service system, and I was able to exchange the defective disk for a new one within minutes and with Amazon paying for shipping coming and going. Thank you Amazon. [[ASIN:B002DHGMK0 Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium]]"
2,"My grandson, 8 months, loves the animal version but doesn't have the same interest in this shapes game. He actually seems to prefer a couple of free apps on my phone to this. Also, we had trouble installing it. Amazon was wonderful about getting us a replacement. The second one gave us exactly the same difficulties--simply stopped at one section. It loaded on the third computer we tried--after 20 minutes of fiddling. Don't bother with this shapes game; go for the animal one by the same company. It's fine."
5,"I played with the consumer preview a few months ago and realized like many that W8 isn't so great when paired with a traditional keyboard and mice; however, this can be remedy with the MS Touch Mouse. Currently writing this review in the new Internet Explorer and the OS works very well when paired with this mouse. I'm surprised how quick boot times are with the OS and so far I'm impressed.<br /><br />I can see this being perfect for non-power pc users. A lot of the preinstalled apps (news, maps, stocks, etc) are great. I haven't left the new start screen unless I needed to access personal files from Windows Explorer."

1,"As stuff happens, I had a HD failure on my old computer. I attempted to reload this program on my new one figuring that since it was only being used on one computer that there shouldn't be a problem. Unfortunately, that's not the case. I find the program won't funtion correctly. I can't load data on the daybook. I can't delete the program and the tech support won't answer my emails. I'm thinking this software is designed to fail if it's loaded onto another computer. I purchased the program on 11/17/06 so it's still should be under warranty. Considering the level of tech support and the maliciousness of the software, I'd suggest you look elsewhere."
4,"I looked at PowerDirector because I'd been using Adobe Premiere Elements (APE), versions 7 and 8, and have too many crashes and other issues; despite even buying and using a highly spec'd new machine. I used APE since 2009, mostly on AVCHD source. The machine I'm using is a Sony VAIO VPCF1, Intel i7, with Windows 7, 8G RAM, 500G 7200RPM hard drive, external Western Digital eSata drive. I purchased this machine in November 2010, with APE version 8 preloaded. I loaded previous projects created on APE 7, but couldn't get past a fatal crash that would occur outputting to .m2ts. I downloaded the PowerDirector version 9 trial version, keeping in mind the controversial reviews I've read here. Actually, I didn't search for PowerDirector based on Amazon reviews, but on other forum comments around the net recommending this software. On to the details of my PowerDirector experience: Pros: It loads quickly, ready for editing within less than 15 seconds. There are several preview resolutions available, so I could choose a level that works almost seamlessly in real time as I move back and forth along the timeline. Outputting AVCHD output (\\""Production\\"") of my 6 minute video took about 15 minutes. No crashes or hangs whatsoever. Applying video \\""fix\\"" effects can be done over all clips quickly; not available with APE. With PowerDirector, a title can be editted several times after being created. With APE, it's turned into an uneditable video clip after creation. Cons: I had to fiddle a bit to get used to splitting and trimming clips, but in all fairness that's a learning curve problem; not the software's fault. Here APE is a bit more intuitive. Fades out or in took a bit of time to learn how to apply (APE has menu pulldowns). Some transition effects didn't work immediately. Closing the program and re-opening solved the transition issue. (Since PowerDirector loads fast, this workaround to the transitions flakeyness cost less than a minute each of 3-4 times I didit. In the future, I might just tolerate it and maybe reload once after finishing other work.) I found a bug: I had two title effects, at the beginning and the end of my video. Though the title effects look fine while editting, the first title would be missing on the output video file. Workaround: I found on the Cyberlink PowerDirector forum that others fixed this little problem by simply moving the title to another video track. That worked for me. So I was able to create my video with all my titles intact, no crashes. Though there are issues, I was able to overcome all and get my video created. Yesterday I created 30 minute AVCHD video without any problems. So based on this experience, and not trusting APE anymore, I'll go ahead and buy the PowerDirector 9 Ultra64 version. My latest video on YouTube: [...]"

5,"I divide land, design and build tracts, and used AutoCAD LT as the [less costly] industry standard for computer drafting inputs to engineers, architects and surveyors. And while LT 2002 does include a few of the important innovations of AutoCAD 2002, its capabilities are still strictly limited to 2-D drawing. Definition used below time in/out, 1 in to 4 saved = 1/4.<BR>True to form and the army of programmers, support staff and professionals, compatibility is one of the key advantages of LT 2002. It is 100 percent DWG-compatible with AutoCAD 2000-, 2000i-, and 2002-based products, allowing me to open, edit, and exchange drawing files with my engineers, surveyors, blueprint shop and partner in Hawaii. <br />I used successfully the Web publishing tools included, worked, however a bit laborious, time in vs. time saved 1/2. eTransmit, for example, puts drawings you currently have open--with all associated files and x-refs--into a single set so that I could edit the file on another machine. Necessary component of a file is present without the user having to individually select all related files. Users can then post the transmitted set on the Internet and send it as an attachment via e-mail, even while changing ISPs a couple of times. Additional Web publishing enhancements, such as templates and themes, have been improved dramatically and all worked. <br />Associative dimensioning works and time in/out 1/4. If you modify a geometric object in a drawing, associative dimensioning automatically adjusts all dimensions associated with that object. Got rid of the need to manually update or re-create dimensions for changes in geometry. All in all, this is a very useful feature. However, it does make it more difficult for users who have grown accustomed to manually forcing dimensions of objects in their drawings. Saved tons of time on text, the dimensions immediately change. New layer, text, and attribute tools, such as text scaling, the enhanced attribute editor, block attributemanager, layer translator, all work.<br />Tutorials and product support will speed up the two days of required start up traing, very easy to learn, but time intensive in the box) provides step-by-step instructions on all of AutoCAD LT 2002's features using interesting and real-life sample files."

My highest recommendations."
4,"If you just purchased your first harmonica then this is the package for you. [There's a harmonica included but not a very good one.] I would highly recommend this package for a total beginner. It will get you started correctly and it also provides additional information so you can eventualy play some \\""good stuff\\"" as long as you follow it and practice. And the seller is up front in indicating that it is for the \\""total beginner\\"". The reason for only 4 stars is that I felt I'd been hustled a bit and no one likes that. It is listed at $55 but the price is now discounted. The box is factory marked at $49.95 which is seller's \\""discounted\\"" price. The truth of the matter is that it's a situation where it's marked up so it could be marked down. Having said that, I'd still recommend this program for beginners."
5,Ok but not compatible with Windows eight

5,I have used TaxCut for a few years and it does a good job guiding you through the process. Having the change of consulting with an expert is also very good. I did it last year.

1,"I wasted my money on this software - don't make the same mistake. It's non-intuitive, inflexible, cumbersome, and does nothing that you can't do yourself in 15 minutes with a pencil and paper.

2,I'm not a skilled technical person but do ok with most technical projects. I've used Trend Micro products in the past without problems. I found this product used up most of my cpu for several minutes when starting up my computers. I loaded it on 3 different home computers with the same results. I tried downloading a fix for an older version of trend software and that seemed to help but still ate up a lot of cpu mem. It appeared to me that it was using most of the cpu mem on start up to run system scans. This might work well on some of the newer computers with a lot of cpu mem but not on on mine. I removed all from my computers and now I'm using Norton 360 which works just fine for me.

1,Don't buy this and change your mind and try to remove. When I removed it it slowed my machine to the point I reformatted the hard drive. Avast is from (from Amazon) and works really well on Windows 7.
3,"Photo Expressions is like the photo organizer For Dummies. It is very simplified and does not require any deep understanding of Photoshop-like tools such as layering and masks. It is extremely simplified. I personally am one of those dummies, and don't like to spend a whole lot of time enhancing. I just crop and maybe adjust exposure and lighting effects. The software itself was easy to install, but now with iPhoto and Picasa from Google I want to simplify my options. There isn't enough features that would warrant me to use this any more than the stuff I can get for free. If you re the creative type and like to print your own CD labels, greeting cards, scrapbooking, then this might be for you. It reminds of the original Print Shop software. I would probably recommend this for the beginner as the interface makes it easy to use, and once you get more comfortable, you could upgrade to a more powerful program for editing and use the freeware for online albums."
1,"This is the second or third business plan builder I have used, and it may be the best I've seen for putting together a plan in a logical, cohesive process. But it is by far the WORST piece of software I have ever used for formatting output and ending up with a polished, professional-looking finished product. This application is diseased with problems in spacing, indentation, tabs, bullets, numbering, and anything else that may be imported from Word or applied within this program. The MS Word export function flat-out CRASHED my MSWord XP Professional, and anything imported from Word ended up with a mind of its own once it hit Business Plan Pro. So here I am with a nice, tidy little business plan -- but I have to completely re-do it in Word and Excel or look like an idiot when I hand it out in presentations. <br /> <br />As much as I appreciate this product's ability to walk one through a business plan, what good is the plan if it is irreversibly locked into an ugly, inconsistent, un-fixable format for printing?"

4,"I had read some negative reviews of Paperport version 14 and as a user of previous versions of Paperport I was concerned. So far I have been happy with this latest version of Paperport with one exception. It crashes when I attempt to rename an item. There is a workaround by right clicking, bringing up Properties, and changing the item name in the Properties window. However, it seems reasonable to expect the Item/Rename function to work properly since this is such a common operation. Also, in my case although the Scan button was not grayed out, it was inoperable. A Web search suggested this may be due to improper registration of the application in Windows 8 and that execution of the Nuance scanner connection tool might resolve the problem. In fact it did. I think a note in an online Readme file would have been helpful. Import of previous Paperport files (.MAX) went smoothly."
5,I have used an older version of Family Tree Maker for several years. The 2009 version provides great tools for researching the entered data. It adds great value to genealogy searches.

5,it fixed my computer. i didn't try anything else so i have no comparison. i have used windows 7 now for 2 weeks
5,I have used Trent internet security for years without any problem. I installed Titanium on a new computer with windows 7 and it is running fine.
4,"I had avoided buying Lightroom (LR) for many reasons before, mainly because I have a full blown version of Photoshop 5.5 extended (PS) and also the Nikon ViewNX (RAW converter) was free and pretty good. So if you are a person looking for reason to upgrade from Lightroom 3 to 4, then this review is not for you. I have no clue what Lightroom 3 has missing or what is new compare to this. I will review this base on first timers for Lightroom and people with experience with PS and ViewNX and some corel paint 8 (which I own too). I also use RAW, not jpeg editing.<br /><br />Wow is the first thing I got to say after 2 weeks of usage. Actually, after one day I was ready to return it since I can do everything on here between ViewNX and PS. What I didn't realized later is how much faster I can do adjust things in LR rather than convert it in ViewNX raw to jpeg and then edit it in PS (either jpeg or through Adobe Bridge, ACR). Here are the plus and minus of Lightroom 4 version the other photo editors:<br /><br />Pluses:<br />+work flow is fast. View NX is now 64bit like lightroom 4, but LR is a tad faster in term of editing and converting raw to jpg. Editing is not as fast as PS, but PS only open up one photo at the time and that is actually done in another software call Adobe Bridge. I learned from ViewNX not to put more than 100 raw files in one folder, or it will crash. So far no crashes on LR4.<br />+I always found Adobe converter Raw (ACR) clunky to use. LR4 adjustments are easy and fun to use. I can open a before and after views side by side and see how things changed, and not from memory.<br />+Noise reduction is amazing, why buy noise ninja, when LR4 does a great job. I don't shoot over 6400iso that much so, I not talking about that level of noise, just small touch up to clean a portrait skin on the fly. ViewNX has no noise reduction or softener. PS5.5 does, but you can do that in a few ways using filter: de-noise and blurring, there might be other ways too.<br />+Saving presets is something I love. ViewNX comes and can read the Camera raw presets (on camera picture profile), but you can't save any of your own. You can do this in PS as action.<br />+I can do about 90% of editing on LR4 compare to what I can do on PS 5.5e. ViewNX can do about 30-40% of what I can do in LR4. I also have a Sony nex so it raw software is even less useful. More in line with opening files from Adobe Bridge and then editing one by one to ACR, but with the level of option of ViewNX (not as much).<br />+No layering (a good and bad thing) here, to do the same option in Photoshop, I can do in LR4 in 25% of the time. To doge and burn I use the paintbrush and adjust the brightness or whatever and it is done and another one for darkness. In PS you have to create 2 other layers, then name them and turn them into overlay. TO adjust the brushes later, you just touch on the dot. Creating mono/duotone is also easier and quicker. Ex: the slider on the right side you can adjust hue, saturation, luminance, buy just looking and siding the bar. In PS those are separate window you pull from the tab, or you can open those tab to the right, basically it is just easier to use on LR.<br /><br />Minuses:<br />-Won't let me save my catalog library on my network server, it must be saved on the computer HD. You can work with raw files on the network server fine. While having the library running off the computer hard-drive is faster, but I used 2 computer at home and sometime I do editing on either one, so the ability of using the file library on 2 computers with lightroom is not an option.<br />-To edit a photo you must bring it into your library also. You don't have to do this with ViewNX or Adobe Bridge to PS. You can open any file anywhere and start editing.<br />-No layering means no HDR or photo merge. Last I checked HDR and panorama are type of photography, well you can't do it here like you can on PS. Also without layering you can't cut and paste and do motion blur. People who do heavy portrait will still use PS for heavy photo adjustment. The Paintbrush on LR4 only adjusts color, hue, etc, but you can't paint color, line on it like in PS.<br />-Lightroom catalog takes quite a bit of space on the computer hard-drive itself (already 2gigs and I had this for like 2 weeks), something ViewNX or Photoshop doesn't really do.<br /><br />Neutrals:<br />*LR4 was touting its highlight and shadow is improved, I think it is good, but I have been doing this on ViewNX and also PS for a while.<br />*can't read Nikon color profile. I adjust my RAW setting on my [[ASIN:B0042X9LC4 Nikon D7000]] and ViewNX will read those adjustments and when I convert to jpeg it is fast. I don't need to look and edit every files.<br />*Book, Slide show, Print tabs are features I wouldn't use that much and don't care too much. I might be interested in the web tab as I might create my own photography website and do have dreamweaver, so this LR4 features might be useful later on.<br />*there are only 4 tools, but they are more powerful then you thing.<br /><br />Is LR a better RAW converter then Nikon own ViewNX? I would say yes and no. Since LR can do a lot more the potential of a greater picture is there. ViewNX does more natural looking image that I haven't created presents to match yet in LR. It can't do noise reduction, which I am using a lot now on LR. ViewNX still does great straight from the camera shoots better, since it read my in-camera raw presents.<br /><br />I am PC person since I own too many software that don't run on Mac, mostly 3d and CAD software for architecture are PC only. But I got to thank [[ASIN:B002I0JKSS Aperture 3]] pricing; no way on earth is LR worth 300 bucks. It is not a full feature software like PS, even if it is faster for workflow. I wanted LR so long and now the price is about right I would recommend it for all the serious photographers. The only true other option might be [[ASIN:B005MMMT6E Adobe Photoshop Elements 10]] which is a gimp version (most features most users won't even notices) of PS and is relatively cheap. I do love the creations I am now getting from LR4. I will link to some sample later in the comment line.<br /><br />For speed reference I am using a [[ASIN:B001MEHXJY Lenovo ThinkPad W500 Mobile Workstation - Intel Core 2 Duo T9400 2.53GHz - 15.4\\"" WSXGA - 4GB DDR3 SDRAM - 160GB HDD - Windows 7 pro]] which is like 3 years old and it works fine.d paste and do motion blur.

1,"I've had home computers since the Timex Sinclair in 1982. The only time I've been forced to reformat my hard drive was a couple years ago after install problems with System Works 2002. I bought 2005 from buy.com because it was $64 with $64 rebates for upgrading. Free but not worth it.<br /><br />I installed 2005 over 2005 that came installed on a new desktop. The pre-installed version had a virus update subscription that was to expire 12/5/05. After installing from the CD and registering I could not update my virus definitions as my \\""subscription\\"" had expired instead of being extended 12 months as it should have been.<br /><br />Now after a few attempts at uninstalling and re-installing, using the advice and programs from Symantec's web site the program is installed but won't run. At times it has seemed to keep unrelated programs from running.<br /><br />If you do try to install this software be sure to have the backups and recovery points ready."
1,Searched online and called Bitdefender. No solution available to stop daily popups from Bitdefender!<br />I don't need daily popups from a company that is suppose to protect me from that type of garbage!<br />Have returned Bitdefender software for a refund. Will try Kaspersky or go back to Norton (both highly rated).

5,"PC-cillin has performed an amazing virus surgery on my computer that Norton Anti-virus and the <br />others could not do. PC-cillin got rid of the most deadly virus immediately after it was installed <br />on my computer, and without even waiting to update its anti-virus database - simply amazing!<br />For about six months my computer was getting sluggish. I suspected it was troubled by virus but, <br />although I updated my Norton Anti-Virus everyday and scanned the entire computer many times over, <br />Norton declared that it found no virus. <br />Then, one day I started using the Bluetooth wireless dial-up modem kit, but the internet connection <br />got disconnected repeatedly. Each time a note would appear on the screen warning that the computer <br />would restart in 60 seconds. I finally contacted the Zoom modem tech support, and the technician <br />immediately identified the problem; my computer was plagued by the Blaster.Worm virus. Now, I was <br />prepared to forgo using the bluetooth gadgets, but to be plagued by the deadly Blaster.Worm got me <br />very concerned.<br />I re-installed Norton, updated it, and rescanned the entire computer many times, thinking that with <br />this fine-tooth comb scanning, NAV might get rid of the Blaster.Worm. Not only Norton Anti Virus <br />couldn't do anything, but Norton publish a big splash on the website with a long lecture on how <br />deadly the Blaster.Worm is. Also, from then on, every time I scanned, a Norton note would appear <br />on my screen, proclaiming that:<br />1. It cannot delete the Blaster<BR>2. It cannot quarantine it.<BR>3. It cannot repair it.<br />Now, what use is an anti-virus software that boasts of its superiority but is unable to help you <br />when you need help desparately? <br />I also tried two other anti-virus software but to no avail. <br />Then, thanks to Amazon for this customer review feature, I chanced upon this web page on PC-cillin <br />and read some encouraging reviews.<br />I immediately ordered the PC-cilling from Amazon, and it arrived at my door step in less than 48 <br />hours! The amazing Amazon! I had opted for free delivery, which was estimated at 7 days, but the <br />quick free delivery was a pleasant surprise.<br />PC-cillin detected and killed the Blaster.Worm plus a few other viruses the moment it was <br />installed. Obviously, I am now a new ardent convert to PC-cillin, and I want to thank the users <br />who took time to share their experience by writing their reviews on this Amazon review page.<br />PC-cillin - keep up the good work!<br />Amazon, your efficiency is simply amazing.<br />HY<BR>California"
4,"I love being able to make my own cards. I've gotten pretty creative with pictures and this program makes it east to do. If you buy nice paper, they look just like a Hallmark Card and there is a lot of variety in styles.The only thing I don't like is that there is no choice for size, you have to use what the design says and sometimes I pick a design that I like but I think it would look nicer if I could do a regular 1/2 page card instead of the 1/4 size."
4,"I was a little reluctant to move to QB Pro2015 because I had received conflicting info as to whether it would be able to convert my QB Pro2003 data without intervention from tech support at QuickBooks. I had to upgrade my computer from a Windows XP to a Wndows 7 Professional and my QB Pro2003 wouldn't run on Windows 7, so I had to do SOMETHING.<br />I am happy to say that the Pro2015 shipped promptly, installed easily and converted all my QB Pro2003 data without a single issue.<br />I'm still getting used to the new interface and some of the changes (like having to save an invoice before printing it and losing the &#34;Remarks&#34; option when posting payments), but all in all, I am relieved that I was able to make this upgrade without a major upheaval. It has all the features I am accustomed to, though the not-so-familiar (yet) interface IS taking some getting used to. I find that I am getting used to the QB Pro2015 quicker than I am getting used to Windows 7.<br />I am also VERY glad I didn't take the leap to the online QB."
4,"It is a great deal, BUT Microsoft should review their activation policy, since that I cannot install the same disk I bought on my laptop, so I have to go and buy another one for the SAME PRICE again!! This will surly decrease the market demand, it will give a \\""boom\\"" to competitors in this condition, specially there are new regulations against Microsoft OS market policy. I suggest a small fee can be represented in activation for a whole new platform, something like that. Thank you."
1,"This software is pathetically primitive and totally inadequate for this purpose. For example: It has fields for only two telephone numbers - a \\""phone number\\"" and a \\""cellphone\\"". No work phone or any other option. There is ONE field for a \\""significant date\\"", no separate fields for birthday, anniversary, etc.!! No fields for children, no more addresses than the one primary address, and lots more missing info. Totally useless program! I sent it back immediately."
1,Never had the slightest problem with pop-ups and questionaires till I installed lousy Kaspersky 2015.<br /><br />The software is bugged up. Safe Money is a joke. Then they have the audacity to deny access on certain downloads.<br /><br />I would rather have bought Norton's. The same ol' installation stupidity.<br /><br />Kaspersky stinks. Don't buy it.
4,"This Quicken (2014) is a very hungry graphics version. I have to close some windows before I use Quicken or I end up with Window stopping and error messages from Norton saying not enough graphics available or too high disk usage. I never had these problems when using Quicken 2012. I'm running Win 7 Home Premium 32 Bit, AMD Vision CPU and 4 Mb RAM with on board graphics on ECS desktop and 320 Mb HDD. All the other programs run fine with out errors. I have not set up the mobile part of the program just yet for fear of having even more error problems. Other wise I really like Quicken and have been using Quicken since the DOS version."

5,"Very powerful and capable software that runs a close second to Adobe's various Creative Suites. If you don't want to pay hundreds more for an Adobe Creative Suite or you don't need to share files with other professional digital graphic or video artists, then CorelDRAW Premium Suite X5 is the way to go.<br /><br />Since the early days of computer software, Adobe and CorelDRAW ran neck and neck for the top graphic design and image editing programs. Since the turn of the millenium, Adobe edged forward and has since sat atop all design, photo, and video software programs. With more acceptance and praise also came a higher price tag.... much higher.... 3-5x times higher.<br /><br />For all of us coveting an Adobe Creative Suite, there is an alternative that works just as well and has many faithful devotees - it's CorelDRAW Premium Suite X5. In CorelDRAW Premium Suite X5 you can do nearly everything that Adobe CS can do and in most cases just as well or better. The capabilities of both software programs are nearly identical - the important difference being the restricted access to file types. Adobe's video and graphic file types have become the professional design industry standard over the years. This is the biggest thorn in the side for CorelDRAW users. To avoid downtime and technical setbacks, it is vital that designers sharing files use the same software and version. Since Abode is the industry standard, a CorelDRAW user will be the odd man out, even though his software is not inferior.<br /><br />So if you want the most capable software, but don't want invest a year of car payments on a computer program, then CorelDRAW is the way to go."
5,"This was a Christmas present, I just love it. I have been going to gyms for years and always wanted a way to introduce new routines to my workouts. I always find it hard to remember the new routines I read in Mens Health magazine or taking cut out pages to the gym. This product simply does all that for me, I use it at home and also when I travel. Basically series of exercise routines that you like to follow with nice clear instructional images are downloaded into your pod. You can exercise and flip through the instructional images while you listen to your music."
1,I've been a Zone Alarm user for about ten years. This is not because I was completely happy but just too lazy to change. It seemed that every year it didn't work for one reason or another and I'd be asked to delete the old version and reinstate the fixed version. This happened again this year. Suddenly my firewall and anti virus stopped working. I contacted them and was told I had the old version (amazing as I'd only renewed my subscription a few months before). They asked me to delete the old version (just like previous years) and download the upgrade. A list of complicated instructions followed. I was annoyed but agreed. The only thing was the download didn't work. I tried 4 times. Frustrated and several blood pressure pills later I contacted their help people. I wanted a refund but they refused to give me one even though it was their error. I was outside the refund period they said. Their customer care is the worst I have encountered -ever. Now I'm without a firewall and anti virus even though I've paid for it. Disgraceful and their assistant was completely unsympathetic to my predicament. Basically he couldn't have cared less in my view.<br /><br />Draw your own conclusions from my experience.
5,Excellent.
5,I made the jump from the original Expression Web software and was attracted by the ridiculously low price for this quality of a product upgrade. If you are a Front Page or earlier edition Expression Web user I think you'll be more than happy wih this choice. If you are new to web design software this is an excellent choice since expression web offers most features you'll find in any high quality comprehensive web design software with the addition of the Front Page extensions options which is a feature I really like as it makes building web pages and saving your work so quick and easy.

5,"I am extremely happy with this product. I can't figure out what the problems are with some of the ratings. These are exciting games for me. I wanted something that I could play like when I was a kid. We didn't have TV or Computers, so we created our own excitement, with either cards or board games. You select your own profile, and select the players the players that you want to play with. These players are always making comments, and it makes the game more exciting. The games aren't dominated by the computer. Both you and the computer have a chance to win. You just have to use logic, like if you're playing a real game. It certainly has the ability to sharpen your mind, plus enables you to have playing opponents. The excitement is to be able to win some of the games. You don't want to be able to win them all. I rated these games at 5 stars. Everyone has their own opinion. I guess it's like everything else. No one is happy with everything, but these games are just what I wanted."

I switched to a competitive product the next year, only because the competitive product had a 2 year lifespan. Also, I didn't like how long it took for updates to come from Norton, nor did I like how they make it sound like you're computer is about to be hacked to death if you don't update it immediately, which happens almost every time you turn on the computer, as they put out updates very frequently.<br /><br />The good side is they are updating, but the down side is listening to their scare tactics to &#34;do the update NOW&#34;. Interestingly, I never got one single virus the entire year, so that made all those scare tactics seem a lot like overkill."
4,"First off I want to respond to the previous users who have upgraded your pc's from Vista, obviously not a good idea whatsoever, you always want a clean copy of xp or system restore the laptop/desktop if you bought a name brand PC. People who are experiencing freezing, what are you guys talking about? There is obviously something wrong with your pc's. I have a Sony Vaio with 2GB of RAM and a Core 2 Duo T5600 with Business on it, and the thing works very very well. Programs not working? Yea, only some of them if they require specific drivers that aren't developed for Vista. People saying Itunes, Firefox and other programs like that don't work, you've got to be extremely dumb not to realize that everything works perfectly. All the programs work listed above and even more now. Service Pack 1 will be released soon enough to fix any minor issues that haven't yet been fixed. If you don't know how to turn things off in the control panel, like UAC you probably should have someone do it for you. That is there for your protection. Windows Aero, can also be turned off if you don't like its little featuers like the popup windows and flipping. My Background: I have 6 computers running all versions from Home Premium to Ultimate of Vista and I have only had minor driver issues, with my sound card. THATS IT. Every company that I know of has perfectly stable drivers for most devices. People who say they can't find drivers for their printers and or other devices must be something that company doesn't support anymore and or they haven't looked in the correct places. Speed? I haven't noticed anything different, but I guess there obviously would be differences because Aero does take more memory to run the 3D interface. Epilisy? Uhh I suggest you go to a doctor, or stop using computers all together if you have this issue. And by the way its under mouse features."

1,"About a year ago I cancelled my cable tv and bought a tuner that was designed to use with windows media center that came with the Windows 7 software on my computer. While I had a bit of trouble getting the digital over the air signal, a new outside antenna fixed that problem and between my Amazon Prime and Hulu Plus, I've been a very happy camper!<br /><br />The other day I bought a new laptop so that my mother in law could watch tv in her room and it came with Windows 8. I read up on this new program and NOWHERE did I see that they were doing away with Windows Media Player! So, I go to set it up and it's not there!<br /><br />I called Microsoft to see where it was and was informed that it would now cost me an extra $99.00 to upgrade so that I could have the media player. I griped and they then told me that I could upgrade to Windows 8 \\""Pro\\"" for $39,99. I didn't see where I should have to pay more for a lessor program, so I requested that they swap the windows 8 out for windows 7 and then we could call it a day.<br /><br />Nope, can't do that! They told me that I would have to contact Toshiba.<br /><br />Maybe I'm wrong, but watching tv was the specific reason that we bought that computer and I don't see why I should have to \\""upgrade\\"" in order to get the same functionality that the older program had...aren't we supposed to be moving forward???<br /><br />I've now been waiting for a couple of hours for a supervisor from Microsoft to call me back and am two thirds towards running over to the Apple store and buying a Mac (which I've confirmed can be used to watch over the air tv with the purchase of a usb turner.)<br /><br />To say that I'm disappointed in Microsoft would be an understatement. VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!<br /><br />Update...I still haven't heard back from the supervisor, so I called Microsoft's corporate number (425-882-8080) and asked to speak with the executive resolution group (or at least someone without a headset on) and was told that I would have to email them after giving them my personal information. I then asked if I could speak with the VP in charge of customer service and they refused to tell me who that was...so, I googled it and found an Blog post by a lady named Barbara Gordon where she slams google's customer service and compliments Microsoft's.<br /><br />I called the corporate office back and asked for Ms. Gordon's office and was told that I would have to initiate my correspondence via the US mail (really?? One of the world's largest technology companies and I have to send them a letter??? Seems like a stiff arm to me!"
3,I like TaxCut. What more can I say. Been using them for a long time. I am used to the things that are missing or may not work so well but each software has its own glitches. I am used to theirs.
1,"I've wasted two hours so far trying to organize my investments. When I called my broker for help, they said \\""yeah, Microsoft Money is pretty notorious for being complicated. We recommend Quicken.\\"" I guess I should have called them first. <br /> <br />I bought this product new, but there are absolutely no instructions so I'm flying blind. It's pretty ironic that software I buy to uncomplicate my finances is too complicated to set up. <br /> <br />I \\""only\\"" wasted $10.99 on this, fortunately. Unless you're well-acquainted with this software before you buy, I'd avoid it."
5,"I don't write many reviews, but the misleading reviews below forced my hand. In one, Word 2002 is dinged because it doesn't open quickly on that person's outdated computer. In the other, it's dismissed as being crash-prone. I have found neither to be true. Running Word 2002 on a desktop (1.5 P4, 52 MB RAM, Windows XP), I find the program to be fast, stable, and able to help me in any document-related task I need to get done. I'm not a fan of Microsoft, but I have to give them props for a terrific WP program and a great new OS to run it on."
1,"After moving from a 32-bit desktop computer to 64-bit laptop running Windows 7, I also needed to update my Roxio Easy VHS-DVD program. I wanted to stick with Roxio because I had used the previous version for years and was was very happy with it. This version, however, is an awful step backward. 1) Video produced by this program is only fair at best. 2) Video can be saved to hard drive in only one format (.mpg). 3) Disk burning is very slow (burning time for a 1.5 hour video was 2 hours). All in all, I am very disappointed with this product and would have been very pleased if it did no more than previous versions. Sadly, Roxio took a huge step backward."
2,extremely limited. No real instruction. Not very useful. They should fotget the debut and go right to the real product if ththey aren't going to give you a chance to use it.
5,"When [a music website] went offline because of legal issues I found myself missing it, and contented myself with using search engines to find tunes I wanted. This program, unlike [music website] which was a peer-to-peer music exchange, seeks out music titles that may be hiding on the Internet. WHile it lacks the convenience I enjoyed, it does a pretty good job of ferreting out files I'm seeking and also has some surprisingly nice features that aren't available from a search engine, such as:<BR>- ability to preview music before you download it<BR>- will not display deal links (search engines hold a lot of dead links in their cache, which you don't find out about until you try to download and get the dreaded File Not Found error)<BR>- maintains a list of sites where you previously found files<br />You can narrow your search to any of the following file types: Windows media, Real Audio Media, MPEG 2, MPEG 3, MP3, WAV or MIDI, or you can have the program search for any media type. No, it's not [music website], but it's better than anything else I've tried since that system went offline."
5,"I've been using Windows 7 since its beta release, but my laptop's been running the final version for weeks now. I really disliked Vista and preferred XP still, but Windows 7 has tipped the scales...finally. Windows 7 has been reliable and it's snappier than Vista. Windows 7 sips laptop battery power so my 1-year-old Dell XPS M1530 runs longer under Win7 than it did under Vista. But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new or improved features it offers. Here's a list of my favorites:<br /><br />#1 VIRTUAL LIBRARIES<br />With virtual libraries, the special folders like Documents, Pictures, Music and Videos have all become libraries. Instead of being a physical storage location, they're indexes that point to one or many locations on the computer you're using, as well as other computers you're networked with. In a home setting, where you're running Windows Home Server, you can now easily direct file stores to your server. When coupled with Offline Files & Folders (a features that the non-Home editions of Windows offers since XP), you can easily take your server data with you, even when you're in a disconnected state. Also in the home, housemates can easily see each others' data by including their respective folders in one another's libraries. When you search a library, you're searching your computer and any other computer that has folders you've added to your library. This is, for me, the single best feature of Windows 7, and is an excellent reason to upgrade.<br /><br />#2 START SEARCH<br />The Start Search has been improved in Windows 7 so results appear instantly as soon as you click the Start button, and then either type the name of a program on your computer, or a task you'd like to perform (like, \\""change my display settings\\""). No more hunting folder hierarchies to find that elusive program, or spend time figuring out where Microsoft has placed something in the Control Panel. This is a tremendous time-saver.<br /><br />#3 AERO SNAP<br />The Aero user interface has three new tricks -- Shake, Peek, and Snap -- but only Aero Snap is a major leap forward. Have you ever tried comparing the contents of two windows together, side-by-side? It's painful to do because you have to fiddle with resizing the two windows. With Aero Snap, now all you do is grab the title bar of one window, sling it to the left, and Windows 7 will automatically resize the window to fill-up one-half of your screen display. Do the same with a 2nd window by slinging it to the right, and it'll fill-up the right-side of your display. You can start comparing two windows in...an Aero Snap. Aero Shake and Peek are cute, but not nearly so helpful.<br /><br />#4 TASKBAR<br />Gone is the Quick Launch bar that too many people didn't know existed. Now, the whole Taskbar is a quick launch bar -- drag and drop any program icon onto the bar, and you're one click away from starting the program. Also, it's so easy to move the taskbar around now. I keep it on the left vertical on my computer. Gone is the system tray, too -- Notification Area takes its place. The Action Center alerts you to anything you need to do to keep your computer working smoothly.<br /><br />#5 PROGRAM COMPATIBILITY (including XP Mode)<br />Any program can be run in one of many compatibility modes now. Windows 7 has a wizard that will help you pick the right, earlier version of Windows under which to run an older program. You can do the same thing more quickly by right-clicking on a program icon, click the Compatibility tab, enable Compatibility mode, and select the earlier version of Windows you want. For truly stubborn XP programs, the Professional edition offers XP Mode -- a fully licensed, virtualized copy of Windows XP. Note that your hardware must support virtualization for this to work.<br /><br />#6 STICKY NOTES<br />Less functional that the Vista Sticky Notes -- which nobody used -- but now I actually use Sticky Notes to put reminders on my Desktop. They're quick, easy, and work just like a regular Post-It note only you don't get fingerprints on your screen!<br /><br />#7 JUMP LISTS<br />There are two kinds -- Jump lists that let you quickly pick a task to perform, and Jump lists to quickly select a document to open and edit in the associated program. These are nice time-savers.<br /><br />#8 SAVED SEARCHES<br />In Windows Explorer, you can create filtered searches and then save them in your Favorites for later use. This is handy to find filtered data in the future. When you re-execute the search, it creates a dynamic results set (so your search is never stale).<br /><br />#9 CONTENT VIEW & ARRANGING<br />Also in Windows Explorer, two new features. Now you can arrange a folder into subdivisions by date (great for your pictures folders!). You can use the Content view to combine thumbnails of files along with details that usually are found only in the Details view.<br /><br />#10 USER ACCOUNT CONTROL<br />Most everyone hated UAC in Vista (even though it helped to keep your computer safe). In Windows 7, Microsoft tamped down the annoyance factor of UAC. You can change your date and time without setting off UAC, for example. You can also decide whether UAC should go into secured Desktop mode whenever it does get triggered (secured Desktop is when your screen darkens and you're forced to respond to UAC's dialog box asking permission to run a program or make a change to your system). You can easily turn-off UAC, too.<br /><br />#11 PAINT, WORDPAD, CALCULATOR<br />All three of these utilities got updated. Wordpad and Paint have the Office-like \\""ribbon\\"" now, and Calculator has a few new memory keys, touch sensitivity, and a Programmer view for those dealing with hexidecimals and binaries.<br /><br />#12 HOMEGROUP SHARING<br />This is the easiest way to share data with others in your (home) network. HomeGroup creates a password that is shared among computers, and that takes care of all the issues with user accounts, file permissions and \\""access denied\\"" problems. While not appropriate for corporate use, this is great for the home. I made this feature last because I'm not using it -- I just think it's a great idea for inexperienced users. Note: all the networked computers need to be running Windows 7 to make HomeGroup sharing work.<br /><br />In short, think of Windows 7 as Windows Vista done right.e a regular Post-It note only you don't get fingerprints on your screen!<br /><br />#7 JUMP LISTS<br />There are two kinds -- Jump lists that let you quickly pick a task to perform, and Jump lists to quickly select a document to open and edit in the associated program. These are nice time-savers.<br /><br />#8 SAVED SEARCHES<br />In Windows Explorer, you can create filtered searches and then save them in your Favorites for later use.

3,"I got this as it was a requirement for another program I use for backups and that new fancy junk vista. It is rather bloated and slow. It appears that they are stuffing a lot into it that most people will ever use. I wish I could roll this back to another previous version that was simple to operate. Buy it if you need it, just keep open source software in mind prior to purchase as Roxio is no better. Update: 1-24-10 After using this product for some time now exclusivity i can say that I am annoyed by it. It does do what it says but you must go on a treasure hunt to find the feature your looking for. i.e. copy disk to iso. I am now also getting nag screens and ads for the newer version. I wish i could recommend a tool that that was easier to use..."
1,"The reviews here are at least a decade old.<br /><br />This software no longer works. At least not on my iMac since I upgraded to Snow Leopard several years ago now. If you run the Starry Night Widget all you get is a report \\""Cannot connect to server\\"".<br /><br />May I humbly suggest that you look elsewhere."
5,"Product arrived at my house a few days earlier than expected, and everything worked perfectly! No trouble at all with the download."
1,"I got the full course of Rosetta. It basically tries to teach you as you were a baby. There is nothing immersion about it. you have to guess what a picture is trying to say. Remember the old saying \\""A picture is worth a thousand words\\"". Basically what Rosetta Stone's pictures are. You cannot always guess what a word is by a picture. Sure the simple stuff. But nothing complex. German is a complex language. Has different case systems nominative, dative, genitive, accusative. There are different ways of expressing \\""the\\"" like das, die, der, des, dem. How are you suppose to know which one is which by looking at pictures and predefined combo boxes? Rosetta Stone just teaches you how to match pictures with words and simple fill in the space. It doesn't teach you grammar at all. Doesn't tell you how to write sentences and surely doesn't tell you how to express a feeling. It's an expensive flash card programme. You are better off learning from books than Rosetta Stone. It's just a media/promotion hype. You will never learn a language just from this program. I learned move from \\""Living Language Ultimate German Beginner Intermediate\\"" and Assimil German with Ease than I did from Rosetta in 2 months. I know more than 300 words and how to carry basic conversations. I wouldn't recommend this product to any one."
2,"I'm sure it is of no fault to Adobe or Amazon, but I was not able to use this serial number to upgrade from the CS3 version on my computer. I probably have a wonky serial number. I will probably have to dump my version and buy a completely new CS5 Photoshop. Rats!!!! I ended up giving it away to a friend who had a good serial number."
3,I like it. Its a bit different from the Pure which I'm used to but very similar. I liked the price on this product (that was one of my reasons for buying it).
1,"Users beware of the payroll changes that have occured with Sage 50.<br />As the previous reviewers have said, they have changed their payroll<br />tax table models. Users cannot enter tax tables in manually.<br />This is a deal breaker for me. Apparently Peachtree has to much money<br />and needs to lose customers base. Good luck with that! I have used<br />them for 8 years and now will be switching over to Quickbooks.<br /><br />The advantages of Quickbooks to me are:<br /><br />1. Most major banks use compatable files for monthly statements<br /><br />2. Most accountants perfer using Intuit's products because of<br /> their support is much better.<br /><br />I've called Sage 50 support and they really had nothing to say about<br />the changes.<br /><br />New year, New accounting program!!!!!!!!"
5,"I've been a comics artist / Illustrator for over 25 years and Sketchbook Pro is the ONLY program I'll draw in. Sure I use Photoshop and others for some tweaking / coloring, but when it comes to laying your ideas out on the screen, NOTHING beats the ease and smooth response of Sketchbook Pro. It's fast, a joy to work in and never lets me down or gets in my way. Can't recommend it highly enough."
5,"This program seems to work better than I expected. It is well-conceived and easy to use. One of the surprises was that it encrypts and stores files faster than just copying them to a backup. How? I don't know. Is it really military-grade and unbreakable for a 100,000 years? I'll take their word for it, but the whole idea of encryption has a weak link that everyone seems to ignore. The security of one's data is only as secure as one's password. Since my password is hardly military-grade secure, neither is the data I've encrypted. If someone really wants to attack my data, he would hardly try to break the encryption itself; instead, he'd break my password and decrypt the material without any effort whatever.<br />All that being said, I'm glad I bought the program and I kid myself that my backed-up data is safe when I take it mobile, despite understanding the weak link in the process. And,heck, it's so cheap, how can one complain? I'd buy it again."
5,Very good info. Thanks
1,If you are a computer expert this might be ok for you. If you are like me this is the worst product to mess around with. It is not people friendly at all. The one that was good was the microsoft money very people friendly. Microsoft stopped its marketing. You are better off creating one yourself if you can get the right template for your needs.Nelson
5,"Very good, just what I needed"
4,"We originally saw this CD at Best Buy, and it was $20. My 7YO son immediately wanted it. I told him at that price, we would come home and check the Internet. Low and behold, Amazon had the lowest price on the web (after a quick Google search)! We ordered the CD, and it arrived quickly. We immediately installed it, and my son played it ALL DAY! Then, when my husband came home from work, my son told him about it, and they both played it all night. It is a great little software program that teaches kids to type and does it with one of their favorite cartoon characters! Thumbs up for this software!"
1,It was a not worth the money. Very difficult to use. Spent more time fixing the paper then if I had typed it myself
5,LOVE IT
3,"but it's not the greatest piece of software. On the upside, it is fairly easy to use. After six years, I think I've gotten my money's worth."
1,"After using TurboTax for the past 6 years, I confidently installed it on my Windows 2000 machine, expecting the same comfortable interface I'd grown to, well, like. I was quite surprised when I received a popup stating that critical Windows 2000 files had been modified, and that I needed to restore them from my Win 2K installation disk! I dutifully did so, and then finished with the TurboTax installation.<br />I was disturbed to find 3 URL shortcut icons on my desktop, which I hadn't requested, each marketing some service that somebody thought I needed to know about. They were wrong and, in my estimation by so doing, arrogant, so I spent some time deleting them and their associated files and icons - a bad start, but just a taste of what was to come.<br />I then attempted the magic of the \\""One Step Update\\"", which (you'll see) wasn't and which didn't. So, I traveled to their website for the manual download. I then attempted to follow the update instructions which, like the initial instructions for Windows 2000, could not be followed as written. I tried anyway, and upon launching TurboTax, was pleased to discover that it had detected the existence of the update file and politely asked if I'd like to apply it. I answered a polite \\""Yes\\"", and watched as it failed in its task, giving a cryptic message which prompted another trip to the web site.<br />I discovered that the web site's translation of the cryptic error message was of no value in resolving the problem, so I launched the \\""Live Chat\\"" option. I'd have preferred the \\""Live Tech Rep\\"" option, but that privilege is reserved for those with ...[money] to spare for each call; not wanting to throw good money after bad, I connected with \\""E\\"", the Live Chat entity. I described my travails to \\""E\\"", who disappeared (dis-something, anyway - never really saw anything of him but characters). After a brief (actually the briefest of) conversations in which I think I failed to adequately convey my plight, he recommended the industry-standard \\""uninstall and reinstall\\"", the first tactic taught in Tech Support 101 and one which automatically presumes all customers are novices and haven't a clue.<br />In the process of following those \\""instructions\\"" to effectively disprove its validity, I discovered the heretofore unknown background C-Dilla installation, which took another half hour of research and downloading and run time to get rid of. By this time, I'd had enough...<br />The end result? I'm switching to TaxCut. This is certainly not what I've come to expect from Intuit, and I'd heartily recommend that you avoid this product like the West Nile virus."
5,"it is really a genuine software, no tricks & no troubles at all after i downloaded it...& also i got it cheap compare to wal-mart. thanks for the amazon.com website...you help people a lot to save money..that is the most important facts that people would know..."
1,Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 4 Student and Teacher Edition stopped downloading the pictures after a month and when my daughter tried to contact yesterday Technical Support she was on hold for over a hour and still there was none available to help her.
4,"After having tested the Red Hat, Caldera, and SuSE versions of Linux, I settled on Mandrake 7.1 and have been using it for several months. The other distros are good in their own ways, but I highly recommend Mandrake for newbies. It has an extremely useful configuration tool, it supports much of the available hardware, and it offers a stable, Pentium-optimized kernel. The last poster seemed very frustrated, which is the reaction of some people who come to Linux for the first time. I'd like to offer some helpful pointers so people will try this OS and not get discouraged: 1. Most distros now have intuitive and very simple installation programs now. 2. The complaint that many internal modems won't work with Linux needs to be clarified-- software-enabled modems, Winmodems, are the standard today because they are cheap to produce. Yet they are truly not modems, because they have no on-board processor and instead use the main CPU. If you plan on using Linux with a modem, and you have no modem or you have a Winmodem, you need to purchase a real modem. These will generally be more expensive ($60-$80) but they are worth it because they don't slow your CPU down and you migrate to other operating systems without worrying about compatibility. 3. Any time you plan on using new software, you should read an instruction manual. This includes operating systems, and there are many books on Linux. 4. Supporting Linux, despite initial frustrations, will foster the already sizable Linux community and result in easier and more compatible versions, as well as showing your support for free software. 5. Use the Linux support community, which you link to from any of the distros' websites. Any possible difficulties you might encounter have been seen before, and the answers are everywhere. Have fun with it."
5,"Received exactly what was advertised- a Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit SP1 installation DVD, with a valid OEM/Refub product key on an official license sticker that can be easily attached to the refurbished PC. This allowed me to refurbish an older PC that someone had sold me with an unlicensed copy of Windows on it. I installed a brand-new SSD hard drive along with this copy of Windows to make it all legit for my dad, and the Windows 7 validation wizard accepted the product key without any problem."
5,"This is a good product. My order was prompt and efficiently handled. It arrived in a timely manner with no problems on my end. It works great. It is a good value for the reasonable price I paid. I would highly recommend this product. I have arthritis and is nice not to have to type all the time. Works just like Microsoft word. Takes a bit of getting used to saying Period, Comma etc but fun to use."
1,"I had calculated my 1040 ahead of time, and was making headway with Turbo Tax, until it required me to document every charitable, tax-deductible entry. That's where I had to give up because I have about 50 of them, from $5.00 and up. It would take too long to type in all of that documentation."
4,"I purchased the Singing Coach just after Christmas....decided to give myself a present. I have found it to be very useful in helping me focus on note accuracy as well as timing. I was a little concerned about ordering after reading a few of the reviews with their problems but now I realize they were probably the operators fault,ie: 1)does not always record a line on the graph when you sing.....make sure the earphone/mouthpiece plugs are all the way plugged into the computer,etc. I do agree that a few more pieces of music would have been nice but overall, it has a lot of options to try different things. I would recommend this product to anyone - even those that have sung for years can have fun with it."
5,I have used H&R Block software for years and shop for the lowest price every year. This year Amazon had the lowest price and I bought it here. H&R Block does what I need at the best price I can get.
4,"Here is my original review: I'm sure this is a good program. It has too many glowing reviews to be otherwise, but I find it cumbersome and counter-intuitive to the point that I'm finally giving up on it.<br /><br />Not wanting to be defeatist, I went back to the program and tried again. The cropping tool is a pain, and I haven't gone into the more complicated stuff, but it's better. More time may bring me completely around."
2,"I expected to get an updated version of the Hoyles Games 2008 that I have. Very disappointed, it did not include some of the games I have on the 2008 version."
1,"I had been a user of TurboTax for several years and was very satisfied with the results and ease of use. I had logged on one day to pick up a copy of Turbotax but based upon some of the reviews here I decided to get Taxcut. Big mistake. Taxcut is very buggy and it even locked up when I was first trying to register it online.<br />I had already calculated my taxes based using my tax info from 2002 and Turbotax deluxe 2001. I figured it should give me a ball park figure since tax laws can't change that much in one year. <br />At any rate TT estimated I should pay in a small amount. When I entered all the numbers in with Taxcut platinum it showed me as having in pay in almost tens times as much. I re-entered the data several times and it would give me different results but always on the high side. I even completed a brand new form and made sure I had the latest sotware update. It said I had the latest update but still yielded very high info on taxes and it wasn't a consistant number even though my tax info was constant.<br />Finally after messing around with this for about ten hours I decided I would just uninstall everything and throw the software disk and everything associated with Taxcut in the trash. Hopefully I can wipe this nightmare completely from my memory.<br />I ordered Turbotax today and I will used that program this year.<br />Taxcut is not a very user friendly program and in some of the interview questions it was mising a specific line number to get info from. Also, the look and feel of this program is a bit on the edge of being amateur/professional. Very similar to some of the shareware programs you can find where somebody wrote the program from their basement. It may be just a cut above that.<br />Looking back on some of the reviews of TT the negative on the product had more to do with the activation process rather than how the program performed. <br />If Taxcut has worked fine for you for years than stick with it but I am never going totouch this program again. I should have know better than to change something that was working fine for me."
4,"Although I couldn't get last year's info imported and had to manually reenter it (the first year I had this problem), the rest of the session went smoothly. The Q&A format is easy to follow and very thorough, and you are shown a current refund or amt. owed, which changes as you go according to your answers. Filing is easy. You can print and mail a form or easily file on line by filing directions. Your form is filed, and you will receive an email when your return is accepted. What could be easier?"
5,"We have three generations of artists in our household so this product generated a lot of excitement. My granddaughter jumped right in on this and figured out a whole lot of things really fast. She was enthusing over it and told me, &#34;give them 5 stars grandma!&#34; and so I did. She loves that she can fix something on one layer without affecting the other layers. She loves the mirror image feature and bringing a picture from the internet to underlay her work. She loves that you can turn the lines up where you can see them or turn them down so they don't show on your picture. And a whole bunch of other things that I don't understand yet. Me being the oldest generation in the equation, I haven't figured a whole lot out yet but I love what I have seen so far. The wonderful thing is that everything is easy to use and the company has provided detailed instructions that are easy to follow. This product has already brought great joy to our household and I know that it will be even more wonderful the more we use it and learn all the bells and whistles."
5,I will only use two words to review the Ouino French program....Tres Bien! This program is so much fun to use that I don't want to leave the computer. Try the free sample and you will see what I mean. Au revoir.
5,"Oh boy! This is by far a very useful program for the money. At least for me it is. Fairly easy to use, it is the basic program so its missing some stuff. But you really won't miss it if your creative. Excellent with the Huion Pen Tablet."
1,Great if you like rosters and trades. Terrible if you want a game to play baseball. There is no way to pitch or field or hit. Everything is programmed. Cheap price makes sense as game is unplayable except for someone who strictly likes statistics.
1,A poorly written software and very unstable when used on different operating systems. It crashed my computer frequently which resulted in a total re-install.
4,"Good program seems to be up to date. On the average a simple program to use if you understand some of the tax jargan. As with all taxes be prepared to stop and look up information on the meaning of a deduction etc.... I've used Turbo Tax for several years, I don't like that every year the price game comes into effect. without state, with state one price another price. Also 09 on the box it states with E file, but doesn't say how many you can e file, printed on the box leads one to think only one e file allowed. 2009 program has really jumped up in price, hope it doesn't price itself off the market !

It lives up to most of the hype. Flaw? It is not as easy to use many of the commands as I would have liked. Bravo? It understands me and enters the text I speak very well."

1,"This supposed registry clean up di what it said it wouold do ..........until my computer was restarted when it decided to corrupt nearly everything (it even corrupted the usb ports. Nothing ois safe. I had to completely reinstall windows 7 and rebuild my computer back to where I had it. It took days. I caution anyone considering putting this product into thier CD drive, be ready to accept the consequences."
1,I was sent the wrong key code. I was sent a key code that upgraded from a prior windows version to windows 8.1 Pro when I needed to upgrade from windows 8.1 to windows 8.1 pro. I ended up returning it and buying directly from microsoft.
1,"This is really difficult to use, because I don't know what they are trying to show you in some of the pictures. The software doesn't explain how to form sentences either. It just shows a picture then tells you what it is in Tagalog and you have to guess as to what they are trying to show you in the picture!<br /><br />It's confusing. There are NO lesson plans or guidance. Just figure it out.. good luck. I have never made it pass the 4th chapter.<br /><br />My husband who was born and raised in the Philippines till the age of 18, and he doesn't know what some of the translations of these words are. Also, there are so many different dialects in the Philippines, it's hard to speak to other filipinos. I have had this software since 2008 and have restarted the lessons at least 4 times. I'm trying to start over again and trying to find help on the internet but no luck so far.<br /><br />I wish this program had a sylabus, a schedule to follow and a way to see the answer in English to make sure I am learning the right term for the right picture and some background on their verbs and sentence structure!!"
5,"I have used more of these programs than I probably should have. This is by far the easiest, most intuitive and most complete program for keeping track of all your investments, for seeing how well your buy sell decisions were and for tallying necessary figures for tax time. Plus cost of program is quite reasonable; however, you should me aware that there is a annual maintenance fee of $39. This is quite reasonable also as it gives you access to program improvements and access to the program developer. I have had occasion to need help on three problems. Each time I sent an email to tech support I had an answer by close of business that day. Good luck on getting that on a regular day. The maintenance fee includes fundamental data on all your stocks and watch list imported in on a monthly basis. Also one of the program partners (I think they are brothers) is an attorney and has just started a blog that adds general financial advice on investing and using the program. It's pretty vanilla right now but, if past history is any indicator, it will improve quite a bit."
5,WebEasy was easy for me to use (even without any programming knowledge) and helped me get a great website up very quickly. The templates are another great addition for the beginner as it had all the structure set up and all I had to do was eneter in the content. A great product for anybody trying to get up thier first website.
1,"My dad brought this home to me in hopes of converting our cassettes and vhs-c's to dvd or at least put them on the hard-drive. This piece of junk had me rolling over trying to get good video display. I tried direct s-video connection, didn't work, so I bought a s-video male to male cord, that didn't work, and I tried about 5 different possible scenario connections, but they all yielded same results. I guess it works for some people, but I want the quality to be very close to what I am copying.<br /><br />Do not buy this product point blank - too much run around. Even for the money it should at least work decently, and for those who had problems even installing I say just give up while you are ahead and return this product to Roxio for them to make improvements on their sorry attempt of vhs-to-dvd, and then release it again once its working. Seems this was nothing but a beta release!<br /><br />Now let me go return this piece of $50 dollar trash to the store. Wish I could rate it zero!"
5,"For a small business, the basic payroll works great. It is easy to set up and maintain. It is also scalable and can expand with my company."
5,"I have used Turbo Tax for many years and I really enjoy using it.<br />It asks questions, walkes you through the process and does a review<br />check at the end in case there are any blank spaces that need filled<br />or changed, etc.<br />Will continue purchasing this item each year. Best way I found to<br />do my taxes. Really easy with e-file too."
4,"Have used Data Rescue PC 3 to recover data from two PCs - one with a failed Windows XP operating system (but intact files), and one that someone accidentally re-installed the factory configuration (and corrupted the files).

4,"I was having so many problems playing media, finding the right codecs for devices, and burning certain dvd formats. Roxio Easy Media has the solutions and they are all in one place. Perhaps my old disc player program didn't have certain formats, I'm not sure but some rental dvds didn't play. The rental store tested the disks and found they played on a regular dvd player but not a pc dvd. CinePlayer shows everything so far. I have a PSP and I could only find Sony's software which was expensive for dealing with only one format. I decided to try the Roxio suite since you get many more programs than just the PSP one. Now when I attach the PSP to my PC the program identifies the PSP and will choose the right codecs. I hear Sony willl have direct downloading to the PSP, but until then I can take the video and music from my pc and do a simple transfer. Before when I burned dvds they wouldn't play on my dvd player. It turns out that there is a separate format and the roxio program has that choice. I can make menus too that will work with my dvd player remote control. I can't say the program is perfect since it did have some types of warning popups. The programs still works but I have to click on the popups and they come more frequently they I would like. I can't figure out if it is coming from Vista or the roxio program though. Still I have all the features I needed for a low price."
1,The 2003 version of Turbo Tax requires you to register with Intuit. If you upgrade your computer you need to re-register with them and so on and so on.<br />Also the program installs C-Dilla spyware that monitors all CD activity on your PC; it continues to spy on you even if you uninstall Turbo Tax.<br />Thoroughly UNRECOMMENDED.
1,"Movie Studio 10, great. Movie Studio 12, so far almost ZERO. After a couple of years of using Vegas Movie Studio Suite 10, I decided to buy Version 12, primarily for the faster processing with the video card in my $2000 Toshiba Qosmio X500 notebook, running Windows 7 Pro 64-bit. Since buying Sony Vegas Movie Studio Platinum Suite 12 from Amazon in late Dec 12, I've asked two questions of Sony Vegas tech support online, and returned one box to Amazon for replacement. Sony has taken almost two weeks each to respond to my two questions, and I had to goose them twice with updates to the questions before I got a reply. The product as sold would not install on my computer, nor would large downloaded files for the three major parts [Movie Studio, Sonic Forge, DVD Architect]. I could READ and copy the installation DVD to hard disk, but I couldn't INSTALL any of the three parts from the DVD nor hard disk nor from downloaded files. As an aside, many other programs installed with ease during January, either from internal/external optical drives, or from hard drives or USB. Finally on 30 Jan 2013, Sony tech support sent a solution that partially worked. Between the *****s below. They sent: An update for Movie Studio Platinum 12 was released today which resolves some issues related to this incident. You may download the new update here. [...] My same-day reply to tech support, and you shouldn't settle for less: ***** \\""V 12.0.756 downloaded and it installed. However, I still can't install newer versions of Sound Forge or DVD Architect later than the ones that came with Version 10, either from the Sony-supplied disk or from recent downloads, [nor all the rest of the DVD that should automatically be on my hard drive]. If you notify me when you have such updates for those two programs, I will download and try to install them, and let you know whether they work. However, when I bought the product over a month ago, I did not agree to be an unpaidBeta-tester for Sony. After I have done your work for you, I expect you to supply me with a factory printed disk that will reinstall in the future with all three programs and supporting features. I intend to post a negative review on Amazon with the problems I've had and will recommend that no one buy the product until my problems are fixed. I will revise it once I am satisfied, with a caveat about buying only the latest production date software. Keep this incident open until you have supplied me with the product I paid for. ***** So my recommendation is to wait to buy this product until Sony fixes it unless you too want to have endless frustration and get a product that wasn't properly tested before release. Keep watching this space. Sure, lots of buyers will have no problems with the original version, but do you also want to take the chance on becoming an unpaid Beta-tester with all the hassles that entails, or do you just want to edit video? Sony Vegas 10 great, but no support any more. Sony Vegas 12, support can take weeks for a reply; not ready for prime-time. And that's before I've had a chance to try the new version which I should have been using a month ago."
4,"I am a huge fan of having a home server. I am bummed by the lack of support. My latest Win8 laptop (Yoga 2 Pro) just cannot be backed up by this software though. With the lack of support, you will find likely things breaking as you go. But I am sticking with it as I drive my music, iPods, WMC PC, laptops, etc. all pulling media from a PC running this software.<br /><br />Poor Win8 compatibility and removal of &#34;Drive Extender&#34; cause the 4 stars."
5,I have used printshop for several years. I am just as satisfied with this version as I was with earlier ones.
1,"I am very disappointed with this product. It works fine when I am logged in as \\""administrator.\\"" But when I switch to another user account, such as \\""kids\\"" there is NOTHING I can do to make it function in that mode. This makes the software pretty much useless to me, as I will not allow my kids to use the computer logged in as administrator, because they will delete things and otherwise make a mess of my files and settings."

Everything is supported on my build I have all the drivers it just works.<br />The only cons i have is it boots up to quick for me to get into the BIOS."
4,I would rather have the safety with a slower connection than another big name product that have given me issues in the past! I recommend this and Amazon offers the best price!
4,"Turbo-Tax keeps getting better and better. I found the step-by-step \\""interview\\"" process very efficient and clear. Being able to enter income and deductions item by item was extremely helpful--I deducted some items that, in the past, I overlooked. The only problem I ran into was trying to correct an error in the retrieval of information from last year's Turbo-Tax data. The \\""help\\"" instructions didn't work; the email response from T-T was just a repetition of the help instructions. After several hours (on and off) of searching, I finally found the way to correct my error."
5,"This may be the wrong forum for this, but I'm here and I'm going to ask my question anyway. I hope someone can give me an answer.<br /><br />I am still running Office 97 -- yeah, I know!! But it works great and and know it like my own backyard.<br /><br />However, I create a lot of PP presentations for my son to use in his middle school science classes. He is running Office 2010 at school. Most of my presentations work just fine on his platform, but there are frequent glitches that we have to fix on his site -- usually late at night.<br /><br />Question -- If I upgrade to 2010, will it read all of my old 97 files?<br /><br />Thanks."
5,"When I first received Expression Web, I was nervous about using this program. I have only used Microsoft FrontPage in the past & my experience with web design is really very limited. It took me a few weeks to learn how to use Expression Web, but now I love it!! If you are just getting started I recommend purchasing Expression Web plain & simple and watching as many videos from the Expression Web web site as possible. Check out my web site I created at [...]. I did end up upgrading to Expression Studio & I like working with Expression Design."

4,My second year using it and I got hit with a virus that disabled it and wiped my Hard drive and CMOS. No phone number for emergency contacts!
5,Turbo tax is an excellent program. I have been using it for years and it gets better each year.
3,"I like my old Sandisk 4GB with old secure utility better. The utility that comes with this flash drive is cumbersome to use.

I wouldn't recommend this product."
5,Great product best price on the net. I searched everywhere nothing beats this bargain on a great anti virus suite.

5,"The Norton Products are great, and we received our order on time. What more can I say! Amazon is the best! Thanks again!"
5,"I have never used this version, but I have used Mcafee antivirus products in the past and they did a good job, so this one deserves five stars by default. <br />What is about Florida that ....."
4,"I don't know about the other reviewers issues with this product, but I have no major complaints. (After I bought it, the program needed a upgrade) I was a faithful Mcafee user until I changed to broadband internet service about ten years ago. The service was not compatible to the software at the time so I switched to Norton and used that company until two years ago. I eventually switched to eTrust and I have not had any major issues like what was left. It stopped the viruses that attacked my system like it was supposed to, it blocked what I told it to do, and the file size is extremely small (Norton was 15x the file size). For the choices I had, I am completely satisfied with this product. Those who I know switched to this product have not had any issues either. By the way, when you guys completely remove Norton from your systems, let me know how since I still have embedded software that I could not remove without using XP manager. I have a brang new copy of Mcafee that gave me a massive headache when I tried to install it to two different computers. I am no slouch when it comes to fixing computers so I can honestly say that I would not endorse a product if I did not believe it was useful."
5,i upgraded to xp on a machine that was running me ... it was a highly unstable os and required rebooting 4-6 times per day when it became overloaded while running multiple programs ... this came to an immediate halt with the conversion to xp ... it's not a mac os by any means but it's a definite bump up if you're on me or 98...
1,"Is it just me or was the curtain not pulled back years ago? Anyone tinkered with Office 2007 lately? Anytime you want to enable a new feature you HAVE to validate via WGA; surely no one is foolish enough to wonder why. Combine that with the atrocious DRM configurations and the constantly nagging UAC (not to be confused with the more powerful and elegantly implemented password/permissions implementation found on unix systems) which continuously displays decision making criteria that most people's mom's will never understand, and it's plain to see Vista is as transparent an OS experience as igneous rock.Many users continue comparing Vista to OS X, Ubuntu and other alternatives to what avail I have no idea. It must have something to do with the minds tendency towards dichotomies. There's a lot to be said for something that can stand firm on it's own, without the need for comparison. Vista can't. Microsoft's ability to disguise their cash crop as something other than just that becomes more obvious with each release. It's unfortunate for those that still can't see it, but time is on their side. Just as it's taken time for Microsoft to drill the idea home that Windows is the only OS available for anyone that wants to participate in the modern age, so to will it take time to pull people's attention far enough back from the shimmering illusion long enough to see outside the matrix. <br /> <br />My hope is that more and more people will eventually decide to unplug from the matrix in order to discover more elegant alternatives that are truly there to elevate experience and productivity instead of only sell, sell, sell. I have no vested interest in such an outcome hence ultimately the shape of things is of little consequence to me and others who have seen the light. I don't hate Microsoft, in fact I could care less. If anything I often feel overly embarrassed in regards to their products and tactics. Anyone who has ever cringed while watching Mikey's phone call to the answering machine in the film Swingers will know the feeling I speak of. Let's face it, \\""the WOW starts now!\\"" more or less sums up the caliber of the company and products at large. How else can Microsoft's decade-late arrival to the power of the Internet be explained? 2007 marks the year the concept of \\""Windows Live\\"" comes to be!? Are you kidding me!? Not to mention the immensity of the innovations behind the initiative: Windows Live Maps, Books, Ads, Spaces, Search, etc. Gee, those sound vaguely familiar. And then there's Zune; \\""Welcome to the Social.\\"" It's all so pathetically embarrassing I can't go on. I almost pity the fools. <br /> <br />Simply put, I know how empowering it was the first time I was introduced to Windows alternatives. A binary breath of incredibly fresh air sums up the experience; something I'll never forget, and certainly wish for others. <br /> <br />Vista, Office, and the overall Microsoft experience is none other than one big \\""Ultra\\"" pop-up."
5,I love the Turbo Tax software. It's easy to use and I have used it for years. It makes tax time simple.
5,Great Thanks
4,"There are other better things I could be doing rather than wasting my time playing computer games. But, if I desire to, I am happy to waste my time playing this game. It is fun and the modern update will probably make the younger generation feel more engaged with properties they grew up with. I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because: 1)you can't adjust the resolution to fit any computer and 2) you need the CD in the player to run and play. I travel with an Acer Aspire One, which needs an external DVD to load and run programs. The idea of being mobile is to not drag around additional equipment. I can load the game but I can't see the whole screen. It is best run on a larger screen. If you have a 12 inch screen or larger, this is worth playing."
1,"As a very experienced retoucher and printer working on a new Mac with advanced graphics cards, CS5 has turned out to be nothing but problematic. First, and foremost, Adobe forgot to make it compatible with most printer drivers. When I try to print an image in CS5, almost all my printing options are unavailable. This was never an issue in CS2, CS3, or CS4. Check the online forums - I'm not the only one with this difficulty. I have to open images in CS4 now to make a print. In addition, I see no speed improvements at all over CS4. This update from Adobe is definitely an over-hyped \\""work-in-progress\\"" and lacks basic functionality on many levels. Avoid it until Adobe announces some major improvements."
1,"Everything about it says Windows 7. So I bought and installed it, and it installed Windows 8.1!!! WTF?"
2,"My comment is relative to system specs. My experiment with ACT produced an application that was slow to load, slow to run and generally unsatisfactory. <br /> <br />Other reviewers such as David Delude, have laid this problem at the door of system specs and/or software issues (resources, spyware, etc). Here are the most relevant system/software specs on my workstation, you can decide for yourself. <br /> <br />Pentium 4 2.8 Hyperthreading <br />1 Gig Dual DDR Ram <br />2 Western Digital Raptor SATA Hard Drives in Raid 0 <br />Clean install of XP Pro fully patched to SP2 <br /> <br />I probably have a total of 6 processes loading at startup. (Anti Virus, Spyware Detector, Kerio Firewall, etc) <br /> <br />I have returned to ACT 6. This software is too expensive for this type of performance. <br /> <br />Just my two cents."
5,One of the many that I have bought. Best price anywhere I could find.
5,Simple to use..... No problems with the Key codes or Sign ons worked just fine.... Never used CAD before and have already self taught on the simple tools ..... progressing steadily on how to use some of the more complicated capabilities... Go buy for the money...would recommend this product so far to date.....
4,"Adobe Photoshop is the industry standard for this type of product. It contains the most features and does more than any other product - that is why it is the software choice by professionals. For photo editing, their lighter version - Photoshop Elements is an excellent product and far less money and has a much easier learning curve. Also, Lightroom is becoming much more popular with professional photographers."
5,"About me: a freshman in college, took three years of Japanese in high school and now am taking it at my university. If you're just getting into Japanese, this is the best $24.95 you'll ever spend in your learning endeavors. It's essentially a sensei-in-a-box. The format is like how I was taught--you learn the writing while learning grammar while learning culture, but in a fluid, logical way. Short of taking a class or getting a tutor, this is the best way to learn Japanese. I even suggest it to those in beginning Japanese classes. It is an excellent supplement. The writing style is genuine and interesting, and it almost feels like the conversation of a close friend. It compels one to read further and takes away any sense of learning as a chore. Rosetta Stone is a poor excuse for a language-learning program. It's essentially a vocabulary building program with no actual thought to teaching the workings of a language. Not to mention that the aesthetics of this program are FAR superior than Rosetta, despite Rosetta's hefty price tag. Continually amazes me. Simply the best language-learning program around."
3,"For the most part, my conversions are the \\""simple\\"" type. I have a Word document and want to convert it to .pdf. . . or. . vice-versa. I wasn't looking for anything \\""fancy\\"". I've used online conversions (which were terrible, for the most part). . .and I've used software from three companies. I've been using \\""Nitro\\"", for the past couple of years. Not perfect, but again for my needs it works fine. I can't say that Corel Fusion is any \\""better\\"" or \\""worse\\"". I can do the same things with both. Every now-and-then I want to edit text in a .pdf file, and I don't find it easy in either software. Sometimes I'll simply convert it to Word and see if I can change it that way. Sometimes it works. . . Sometimes it doesn't. If what you're looking for is something inexpensive to convert files, and that's about it. . .then this (or Nitro) is not bad. If you're a \\""professional\\"", then I think you probably want the \\""real thing\\"". . .Adobe. FYI, Nitro is no longer called \\""Nitro\\"". . .

5,"I have both Microsoft Office, and, Microsoft Works 9.0. I like MS office. I LOVE MS Works. MS Works 9.0 is full enough featured for my needs, and much easier to use than MS Office. MS Works also has templates and programs that MS Office lacks. Overall, if I had only one piece of software on my computer, it would be MS Word."
2,"Moneydance is an excellent program for managing your finances, but my low rating comes from the fact that in order to use it, you have to look at it. The UI has been destroyed. The new font for the register is marginally readable, the monochrome wireframe icons are hard to figure out, the program icon (that rests in the dock) has been replaced with an inscrutable symbol, and the color scheme is worse than garish. Customer complaints about the UI's cartoonish appearance have gone unaddressed. Looking at it doesn't turn you to stone, so they can't change the name to Medusa, but it comes close."
2,"The good:<br />The converter works (on non-copyrighted source material) to convert from DVD to MP4 that works on IPads and IPhones. It works a little faster than some I have used for the conversion.<br /><br />The bad:<br />Not that surpringly, it does not work from copyrighted DVD's. Even with a non-copyrighted DVD the front end is messy. You have to look through all the DVD sub-files to pick the ones you want to incorporate and select \\""merge\\"" - otherwise you wind up with a bunch of separate MP4 files.<br /><br />The worst:<br />For the limitations I noted, the price is way too high."
5,"The 12th year for me using turbo tax and it has never let me down. I am sure, god willing, I will be using for 12 more!!"
3,"I purchased this to open files created with version The Print Shop version 14, but it did not work. Apparently somewhere between 14 and 23, the file formats changed completely."
4,It works well as a loop based music creator. I am still having issues with direct reording. I get signal on the screen indicator but no sound when usin asio interface. Direct recording into the mic input is sketchy at best.
1,"I have rated this program with one star because I couldn't get it down to zero stars. I have been unable to get this program to do anything that I have wanted it to do. I tried the tutorials, no help. I e-mailed Corel, no answer. This program is a waste of money. You would be better spending your money on a box of crayons."
4,Got this to upgrade a lap top that was till on XP. Installed easily with no issues whatsoever and working fine.
5,It's has more features than google notebook. The only downside it's not free like google notebook.
5,Both Amazon and the company who sent the game were great! I could not get the serial number to work and both answered my call for help and I am now playing the game and loving it!!
4,WORKS GREAT
1,"My experience with Storefront, and more importantly LaGarde, has been absolutely miserable. The documentation has massive wholes in it and excludes information on setting up the most likely configuration. It also misses key points througout the site building process. ... <br />Unless you are already an .Asp expert (if you are, you would not likely buy this product anyway) - DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
5,"This is much more capable than the Corel tool I paid twice as much for years ago. And there are a number of good YouTube video's to help get started. But it does have a flaw --- almost everytime I go to add a shadow in the \\""Text and Title\\"" generator tool ... it blows up. So save often. Other than that, I love this software and even bought an extra copy to give to a friend. In spite of the one flaw, it does alot (I'm still learning more of what it can do) and it does it well. Have used this to publish to YouTube and to burn a DVD, both were very easy operations. The slideshow is not as easy as simpler tools --- like Microsofts free tool, but this is a video editing application, not primarily a slideshow creation app. It does create a very nice slideshow, you just have to get used to how it works. Highly recommended if you are getting started with video editing. A great deal for the price."

Encoders are free, you get a dedicated music and photo editor, plus some other important enhancements.)<br /><br />Bottom line: MEP 2013 (a.k.a v19) is really a \\""point\\"" or incremental upgrade rather than a new version. There's no compelling reason to buy this \\""version.\\"" (I guess, like cars, they have to introduce a new model every year, whether needed or not.)<br /><br />In fact, in my tests, when it comes to encoding YouTube video (MP4) it's worse that the previous version. (See my accompanying video, where I recorded VLC player video of the same MP4 project encoded by MX vs 2013.) In fact, per the update below, the third party MP4 encoder that ships with Magix 2013 is still \\""beta!\\"" So the previous version 18 (a.k.a. [[ASIN:B005EJ2O9W Movie Edit Pro 18 MX Plus]]) is what you should buy.<br />====<br />UPDATE November 24, 2012: First, Magix just issued its second patch for v2013. Current version is now 12.0.2.2. They say they fixed a few things and I'll take their word for it. (Update December 6, 2012: After the patch, or after upgrading to a new (better) video card, I cannot play the Magix Demo anymore without the program hanging. Whereas I can play the Demo just fine on old v18 MX.)<br /><br />Second, they updated the third party Main Concept MP4 encoder! But it's still not right.<br /><br />Well at least Main Concept is updating their encoder. So there's hope. It's still not ready for prime time and I still have to use Magix MX (v18) to encode MP4 to get the results I want.<br /><br />Update November 2012: On an aside, Fry's Electronics had an Nvidia GT610 2GB video card on sale for $15 after rebate today. (CUDA 2.1) I installed and tried it this evening (pre-patch) with v2013. The new card works better with v2013 than my old card, an Nvidia GeForce 210. (CUDA 1.2) But even with a CUDA 2.1 engine, MP4 encodes in v2013 are still problematic.<br /><br />So I still say MX (v18) is the version to buy. Even though MX doesn't recognize my new GT610 video card for Hardware encoding ( I even uninstalled and reinstalled MX after I had installed the new video card. Perhaps the card is too new?), I get the best results encoding in software anyway. Faster than using the GPU too. (4 core AMD Phenom, 3.4GHz.)<br />=====<br />Review: I've been a happy MEP user from v12 to v15, then v17, v18 (a.k.a. \\""MX\\"") and today, this, v19 (a.k.a. \\""2013\\""). It just came out. Fry's sold it for $25. While I don't mind having spent only $25, it was a waste of money and it's not worth upgrading. In fact, it's arguably worse! Stay, or buy, Movie Edit Pro 18 MX Plus and you've gotten the biggest bang for your buck. (See my 5 star review there.) For example, v18 came with a nice, thick, printed user's guide. v2013 does not. (Instead the PDF on the DVD.) As it turns out, there's a reason for not supplying a printed version this time. The product was released before even the PDF caught up!<br /><br />I use MEP to make YouTube videos. Probably overkill, since MEP is a professional package, a consumer version of Magix's Video Pro X series. But I have availed myself of some fancy features in my YouTube videos using the Multi-cam feature and Picture in Picture. (If you can imagine it, you can probably do it in Magix.)<br /><br />So my focus is on basic time line editing stuff. I don't burn DVD's with fancy chapters or menus. I don't do 3D. (A dying fad.) I don't have a fancy AVCHD camera either. I just import MPEG-2's or MOV's or AVI's, which goes fast enough in v18. (I suspect, in this day and age of cell phone cameras and pad cameras, not many people are doing AVCHD and/or 3D either.) MP4 performance for YT uploads is what's important to me.<br /><br />Here's the biggest difference I can tell with this new version: The third party Main Concept H.264 MP4 encoder has been updated in v2013.<br /><br />So first off, I couldn't import my old export presets (.PRU files) to the new version. Well, I could. But I don't think everything transferred the same. Or maybe the new encoder is a bit buggy and switches aren't getting set properly. For I took old v18 projects, opened them in v2013, and encoded to MP4 as before. While the time to encode was about the same or perhaps slightly faster (when I used my CPU, as opposed to my GPU), the file sizes were larger and, at first, the videos wouldn't play completely through! And when they would (after some tweaking of complicated MP4 encoder parameters) they were badly pixelated on zooms. (See my video review here.)<br /><br />I tweaked the \\""academic settings\\"" in the advanced options of the MP4 encoder for hours in MEP 2013 to match the parameters in v18, but even then I could not achieve the same excellent results as I had gotten in v18. (Defined as good quality video and low file size.) So maybe I'll edit in v2013, and encode my projects in v18. (I presume project files are backward compatible, but that wasn't true from v15 to 12. Update: I have made a few projects now in v19 and opened them in v18 without any problems.) Or maybe not. There's no real difference in the interface that I can tell either.<br />====<br />UPDATE: I was finally able to get v2013 to make good MP4, but at twice the file size of MX! I wonder if this isn't a purposeful decision to win speed contests (at the expense of file size) to win PC Magazine reviews as the \\""fastest.\\"" But I'd rather take an extra minute encoding to a smaller file size now to save 10 minutes uploading later.<br />====<br />To give some history, Magix made its biggest speed and interface improvements in v18 (\\""MX\\"") which took advantage of your graphic card's GPU. That made it so encoding went faster but used your CPU less! Amazing. It's obvious Magix has written even more code to use your GPU in v 2013. But I only have a low end Nvida card, with limited CUDA support (albeit DirectX 11). As such, when I tell the program to use my GPU to encode an MP4, it takes four times longer to encode as compared to letting my CPU do it! (Although my CPU is only at 20% when using the GPU vs. 75% w/o.) But when I let the GPU do it in v2013, I lose some MP4 encoder functionality. Fortunately, using the GPU is user selectable. YMMV, depending on the graphic card you have. But I suspect we're already on the diminishing returns part of this curve. I mean, it takes only a few minutes to encode a five minute YouTube video with v18. Would it really matter to me if it did it in a minute? (I guess if you're making family videos that fill entire DVD's, speed becomes important. But in this day and age of Twitter and 140 character messages, does anyone sit down that long to watch long videos anymore?)<br /><br />As far as interface improvements on v18, Magix is moving toward more use of the preview monitor for some editing tasks. So now you can open a video in the preview monitor and do your in and out trims intuitively before placing them in the movie. (No multi-trim, per se, but you could trim here, drag and drop, and then repeat to get the same result as multi-trim.)<br /><br />Magix claims some \\""improvements\\"" from v18, but nothing I thought was lacking in v18. For example, Magic says the Title Editor is improved. But I'm hard pressed to notice any real difference. (I think they undid some of the \\""improvements\\"" in Patch 2.)<br /><br />The only really new thing Magix hypes is speed improvements for high end AVCHD importing on high end systems. \\""The AVCHD file import feature has been improved and is now more than 40% faster*. Rendering test projects (AVCHD Full HD) with Intel Quick Sync Video, AMD/OpenCL(tm) or NVIDIA CUDA(tm) for the Apple iPad is now up to twice as fast in Movie Edit Pro 2"" But that's for the iPad. Frankly, I bet most people download stuff into their iPad off the net instead of making their own videos for them. Again, I make videos for YT. So, not to take anything away from the Magix software engineers, none of these speed improvements matters to me.<br /><br />\\""Calculating effects directly on the graphic card's GPU is now over 90%* faster, the biggest speed boost out of all the improvements.\\"" Maybe so. But I must not have any bizarre effects that slow things down because I've never noticed a problem with previews. Version 18 came with preview rendering, where you could pre-calculate difficult transitions. But I never needed to use it. I don't make eye candy transitions and effects. (Content is what matters.) Update: For grins, I tried a fancy 3D transition. Okay, on my overclocked 4 core AMD (3.4GHz), the playback is jerky if you don't pre-calculate. I suppose if I had a high end GPU graphics card, it would play smoother on preview. But I don't ever expect to use this transition. Update December 2012: With my newer video card, the transitions do render better in preview.<br /><br />So, if you want to update MEP from an earlier version, update to v18. If you own MEP v18, stay there. If you're looking to buy MEP, buy v18. It's cheaper and makes better MP4's than this newer version. At least at this point in time. If they ever fix the Main Concept MP4 encoder, then this version would be acceptable.<br /><br />I usually only update to every other version and I would have been wise to wait for a v20 before spending any money. Although, at this point in the life of MEP, I don't know what else they could add. (It would be nice if the program could read my mind so I didn't have to change between ripple modes.) As it is now, v18 does most everything I want and it does it well. (Even if I had the full blown Video Pro X, what difference would it make? I don't even know what \\""3-way color correction\\"" is. Update: I watched their tutorial on this on YT. Okay, even now that I know what 3-way color correction is, I don't see any need for it.)<br /><br />Truly, I don't know what more one could want in a video editor. (Some professional reviewers want \\""multi-trim.\\"") But Magix, if you're reading this, I'd like an in sutu bitmap editor, where I could draw a mask (square, rectangle, circle, ellipse, with or without feathering) in the video monitor and use that as a selection to pixelate parts of images, etc. (To be fair, in v19 (2013), Magix did make it so you could open their bitmap editor from MEP, make a mask, and kinda sorta resave that new image for use in MEP. So they're getting there. It's a bunch of steps now, which I expect will be streamlined into the Preview editor in a future version someday."
4,I ordered Proposal Pack Wizard in 2011 and the Professional Proposal Kit. I have used these products to write winning proposals for my business. The templates were easy to understand and follow. I was able to write proposals specific to my business. I would recommend these Proposal kits to any business or individual who wants to writes great proposals or business plans.
1,"trust me, msp is the worst, just get the demos of this and msp 6 and you will find out, it renders 5 times longer(on my AMD/Athlon, 1.3Ghz, 256ram, 60gig hd)than MSP 6.0 VE. This is not a good buy, you will be definetly disappointed."
5,"If anyone's freaking out over the new interface, there's a classic desktop you're used to that you can get to with one click.<br /><br />That's it. One click.<br /><br />The Control Panel-type windows are virtually the same from Windows 7.<br /><br />All this is, is an updated kernel so that the OS can be installed almost on any device in the same way, anywhere, everywhere, all the time and for greater incorporation into the cloud.<br /><br />If you have a touchscreen monitor or device. Cool! You can slide things with you fingers! If you don't, you can slide stuff with your mouse!<br /><br />It's really fun and easy to use with the stability of Windows 7 and a classic desktop if you want it.

2,I was very disappointed in the 2011 Hoyle Card games software. I have an older version that is much more detailed and user friendly. The reason I bought this one was because my new computer was not compatible with the older version. Not being able to view the software and being unable to return it was disappointing. I made the assumption that because it was a newer version that it would also be a better version. I would be leery about purchasing software on line again.
5,"Finally...A resourse for spiritual development that takes into account that we don't all grow in the same way! The assessment was fun to take and unbelievably accurate.

Wow"
5,Works great. No issues.
1,Received product and attempted to activate it over the Internet and over the phone. Both failed with message stating the product key was blocked by Microsoft. DO NOT PURCHASE from this buyer!
5,I already did the installation of the Norton Antivirus and it was straight forward and it is working excellent!!!!!
2,"This is fun but useless for business applications. I want to be able to work with Spanish speaking clients in the tax field. The headphones fell apart. The microphone was iffy. Two wires came loose. Could not load level three. When verbal recognition was turned on, it was sometimes perfect, then it could not hear me or it was not happy with my pronunciation. Too much money for not useful information. Diana"

1,"For anyone considering buying the Symantec Norton SystemWorks product, I would advise them to consider these failures of the product and support. In Feb. 2008, I contacted Symantec by chat because my Norton SystemWorks subscription had expired and a \\""subscription expired\\"" alert was displaying every 30 seconds. When I chose Renew inside the product, as documented, the Live Update dialog was displayed instead of the Renewal Center panel. I waited for the chat through the 67 customers who were ahead of me. In the chat session, the technician could not make renewal work inside the product and eventually sent me a link to the Symantec site to renew, which I did. The product continued to display the subscription expired alert. The technician suggested a couple of options to stop the alert, which did not work. One of the options would have terminated the chat, which I told him when a message was displayed that indicated this. The technician was still in the process of trying to stop the alert messages when the chat connection was lost and the chat terminated. I was left with subscription alerts popping up every 30 seconds after I had resubscribed, and after rebooting. When I resubscribed, I noticed that the \\""Subscription Service\\"" date inside the product on the antivirus status screen was 5/9/2008 instead of one year later, 2/13/2009. From reading tech tips on the site, I determined that when I renewed, the system date was 5/9/2008. I corrected the system date, and the alert messages stopped. But I still had this problem: How do I reset the Subscription Service date inside SystemWorks to the correct date (2/13/2009) so that it does not expire in May and I have to try to contact tech support again? After the chat which was disconnected, I submitted the question to tech support by e-mail. After several days had passed with no response, I confirmed that no Symantec mail had been blocked as spam, then resubmitted the question twice. Although e-mail response is committed to 96 hours, I have received no response 36 days after the original incident date. I feel that this combination of failures of product, technical support by chat, and technical support by e-mail is noteworthy, even today when technical support routinely ranges from poor to abusive."

5,"As the owner of a quickly growing business I need a software that will provide all of the word processing capabilities with the graphics capabilities and Microsoft Office SMALL BUSINESS 2003 does all those jobs very well with Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Business Contact Manager AND Publisher which allows me to do my communications, my record keeping, my client contact management, my presentations AND my own business cards and letterhead and brochures and flyers that look GREAT! I am very happy with this since I do not need Access as a database it saves me money."

4,"It's Quickbooks. Works well for our purposes, but they need to do a better job at sizing the windows. Sometimes I find that I can't get a particular window to shrink (but not every window), and yet, it is not small enough to see the entire thing."
5,"I was so hesitant to purchase Quicken due to its overwhelmingly negative reviews on Amazon. After my mother-in-law assured me that she loved it and that it would probably make my life easier (since I had been manually inserting all of my individual expenses/transactions into an Excel worksheet), I decided to bite the bullet and give it a try. I am so glad that I did. All I was looking for was an easier way to organize my budget, and that is exactly what this helped me do. I can easily categorize individual transactions, which are automatically imported for me from my various bank accounts and credit cards. I can even \\""split\\"" transactions, which means that when I go to Target and spend money on groceries and personal care items, I can categorize those purchases separately (even though I bought everything in a single transaction).<br /><br />In short, I love this software. It is simple and straightforward, so easy to use, and even faster to set up. I see from other reviews that people were looking for Quicken to help them manage their investments and were disappointed with the results of trying to accomplish that goal. It sounds like this program may not be the best at doing more complicated tasks like that. But, for me, Quicken was exactly what I was looking for, and it has saved me LOADS of time. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to manage their monthly budget quickly and easily."
1,"This software will not work with my computer which has Windows XP Home on it. They provided two work-arounds, one didn't work and the other one was to start pulling RAM off of the computer. LUDICROUS! This product should not be marked as compatible with Windows XP."
1,"I stayed on the phone at least 6 hours yesterday and spoke to 2 people who did not know what they were doing and then was placed on hold, placing the phone on speaker and finally gave up. The software does not convert QuickBooks as easily as they say. I basically will have to manually set up everything. I really want my money back as who has time to do this. This is a gravely misrepresented product. Please refund my money!"
1,"My original purchase from Roxio was v. 5, and it caused win98se to crash continually, then when I purchased v. 6 everything was fine. When I bought a new computer with vista I could no longer use v.6, so I downloaded v. 9 suite. Then the nightmares began. I have reloaded 9 suite 4 times because it caused system to crash. Then I looked at the system stability chart and saw that Roxio had caused the stability to go from 9.9(out of 10) to 1.6. Also, a month ago I was notified that my \\""trial\\"" version had expired. I had purchased the full version. Roxio sent me a \\""fix\\"" and it functioned again. Also, Drag-to-disc will not work- windows shuts program down due to compatiblity issue. The patches do not work. Also, each time you do a reinstall, you first have to do a \\""clean\\"" install, meaning you have to go into the registry to remove all files. Even then, there are traces of the program in the system that will corrupt the OS after reinstalling.(Yes, I turned off Windows Defender and mcafee). I have asked Roxio repeatedly to send me a disc with all the \\""fixes\\"", but they just send me form letters. I have removed all traces of Roxio from my system and now the system stability is great. DO NOT USE THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE IT WILL CORRUPT YOUR SYSTEM."
2,"Normally I might wait to install a new software upgrade, but I just got a new laptop and thought it would be best to use Office 2007 with the new Vista operating system. I was wrong. <br /> <br />You would expect that a multi-billion dollar company like Microsoft could put out a powerful and bug-free piece of software. But after a month of using Office 2007, you get the distinct impression that this software is not ready for public release. Microsoft should be ashamed. <br /> <br />I don't know the root cause of my problems, but I have to stress that I am running a clean install of Office 2007 on Vista, so there shouldn't be any software conflicts or issues. <br /> <br />So what are my issues? The list is long: <br /> <br />-- My biggest concern is that MS Word constantly hangs and stalls. It can making editing a document very painful. I suspect the problem is when I put images or Visio diagrams into a document. But that is something the old MS Word was able to do without an issue. Oddly, if I have a colleague open the document and save it out in Word 2003, the problem goes away! What?! It's killing my productivity. <br /> <br />-- When ever I cut and paste from an old document, Word hangs for 15 to 20 seconds. And often the formatting and margins in my new document go haywire. I keep having to spend a ton of time fixing things. This never happened in the old Word. This is another time killer. <br /> <br />-- Every few days, Outlook 2007 starts telling me that it cannot display my email folders. Uh oh! I have to completely restart my computer to see my email again. <br /> <br />-- Outlook 2007 breaks many graphic emails that people send -- they look like a mess. It is because Outlook 2007 does NOT render HTML correctly since it uses the Word engine, not Internet Explorer to display email. I have no idea why Microsoft did this, but they have got to fix it. <br /> <br />-- Many of the issues in the old Word 2003 still haven't been fixed. If you place an image, it canoften be hard to get it to appear correctly. Why can't they solve this one? <br /> <br />-- While most Office programs have the new ribbon interface (which I like), some programs like Visio 2007 do not. So you have to remember how to use two interfaces. Couldn't Microsoft find the time and money to update ALL its programs? Give me a break. <br /> <br />-- On a few occassions in Visio 2007, my files have failed to save correctly. At first I thought this must have been my fault, but it's happened to me a few times and can't be a coincidence. A few times I've gotten an error message and lost my work. Ug. <br /> <br />-- Word and Excel 2007 use a completely new file format. So anyone you send a document to has to have 2007 installed (which isn't likely the case). To get around this, you can save it down to a 2003 file format, but then you end up with two files on your hard drive -- one in the new format and one in the old format. What a pain! Also, there definitely seems to be an issue with Office 2007 opening older Office 2003 files. Could be the cause of many of my problems, but there is no way I can avoid using old files. They should have worked harder on compatibility. <br /> <br />There are good things about the new 2007. I do like the new interface design and the new features in Outlook 2007 are amazing for organizing tasks and sharing your calendar. <br /> <br />But I don't think it's fair that Microsoft released a product so full of serious, serious bugs that have cost me hours and hours of extra work. I didn't spend hundreds of dollars on a beta product and don't think the public should have to suffer. Surely they can afford to do better! <br />"

1,"The \\""Excellerator\\"" may have been an up-to-date program when it was created (which I doubt, due to the methods of changing the WIN.INI file and other equally pre-95 Windows fixes), but seven years later it most definitely is not.<br />\\""Excellerator\\"" is presented as an up-to-date program on par with other current educational programs -- working on WIN 95/98/2000/XP.

(At the very least, most people will have to lower their color resolution or the programs will not play at all.)<br />* If they run, the programs ONLY install in Root Directories (I tried several variations and it only accepts Root) and are totally oblivious to the concept of an \\""uninstall\\"".<br />* They are not recognized in the \\""ADD/REMOVE Programs Profiles\\"" (the only small blessing in removal --- IF you can find all of the directories, files and line changes it has made).<br />* The programs are unaware of registries and create & overwrite several .INI files. <br />* The files are created/changed without giving the installer a chance to accept or decline those changes. <br />All in all --- since only 2 of the 4 disks actually work -- AND those two require so much pre-installation prep-work -- these are not a good investment as compared to many newer, equally entertaining and educational programs."
5,"As expected the 2010 version exceeds all expectations. I really liked the look and feel over previous versions. Still a bit of a learning curve but that is to be expected. Besides, when you do the work and figure things out all on your own, the lessons are well learned. Thanks Microsoft and Amazon."
5,"I'd heard Norton 2009 was a dramatic improvement over previous editions and, since Zone Alarm still won't work with my 64-bit Vista, I canceled my Zone Alarm purchase and got Norton Internet Security for the three computers in my house. Just out of curiosity I find myself checking it from time to time just to be sure it's working. It is, of course. It's just much more unobtrusive than any security suite I've ever used before. So far I'm very enthusiastic. And since I've also heard the telephone help has been improved, it feels like I'm going to get very comfortable using Norton exclusively for all my computers."
2,"My accountant requested I upgrade from Quicken to QuickBooks Pro. The interface is not nearly as intuitive as it could be. For example, it is not possible to make deposits using the &#34;check book register.&#34; Entering other data at times causes convoluted glitches to occur. The required registration had glitches too. Although I followed the (for once intuitive) procedure to completion, the program said I had not yet registered, and had but a few, decreasing number of days to do so. But, it would not let me either begin again or &#34;complete&#34; the registration. This required a call to Intuit, whose telephone number is not on the box, and is not immediately accessible on their website (for example, there is no &#34;contact us&#34; on the home page). That required a half hour on the phone waiting for a 30 second fix--apparently this happens all the time; the phone rep knew what had to be done. Finally, I had all my data entered and was ready to meet my accountant with plenty of time to prepare the taxes. My accountant's 2012 QuickBooks Pro could not read the data from my 2013 QuickBooks Pro. Come on, Intuit. That's just rude."

You get the whole menu on your screen, you pick what you want, and bam, your video is now recording right to disk.<br /><br />Quality? It's fine, you're going from tape to DVD, it will still be tape quality.<br /><br />Cautions: Make sure your computer/laptop isn't too old. This item NEEDS USB 2.0. Get an PMCIA adapter card if you're still running USB 1.1. Online auctions sell them cheaply."
5,I have been using &#34;Tax Cut&#34; for many years and have been very satisfied with it. It bring forward the data from last year quick and easy. And this year they added more companies that you can download data from and it was quick and simple. I will be using it again in the future.
5,"I bought this Windows 7 installation DVD to load the OS on a new Intel NUC. The DVD packaging did not include a disc sleeve, but the media was in great shape. The product installation code was VERY VERY small and hard to read, but it was on a sticker that could be placed on the system, so I give the size a pass. Very pleased that this OS is still available."
1,"I bought this software six months ago and I still haven't been able to use it. I have had to call support several times and they have had to reinstall and fix and fiddle with the microphone, etc. I get past the checks for volume, etc., but I cannot get it to understand my dictation. I've even yelled into the mic and they said my voice was too low! I don't know what's wrong with this product, but I'd like to return it. However, the return period expired in January."
5,thank you...
1,"I purchased OSX 10.6 \\""Snow Leopard\\"" about a month ago and can only say: WARNING - DO NOT install on your Mac! I have a new 2009 8-core MacPro with 6Gb of RAM. After installing Snow Leopard: 1- Most of my software seemed a lot more crash-prone, one program in particular that I use fairly often crashed on average after 5-7 minutes of use, every time. 2- Another program would not start at all, Images from my digital camera could not be transferred because of this. 3- I noticed immediately that my computer was a little slower after the upgrade, but after updating to the latest patch (10.6.2) it got unbearably slow. The little spinning rainbow would appear all the time and software would freeze for seconds at the time. After rolling back and re-installing Leopard from the discs that came with my machine I noticed a significant overall speed increase, but I also had to reinstall several programs, updates and transfer all my files. A major hassle that has taken me several hours and been complicated. Conclusion: DO NOT CONSIDER INSTALLING SNOW LEOPARD! PS! If you want to reinstall a previous OS, make sure you select the option to save the current OS (Snow Leopard) system files and other user files (your files) to a separate folder. Unless you do this the install will delete all your files.."
5,"I had a bit of a delay in getting the software started, the support hours are fairly limited, but once I got the help I needed, everything has gone swimmingly. I'm editing my previous review to reflect that.<br /><br />Once running, the software is extremely easy to use and follow and although a bit simplistic at first, there is a definite progression into more difficult techniques.<br /><br />I think this is a near perfect transition for a player who knows the notes on the strings and wants to learn rock power chords and move from playing note by note into chords. For those players who can read tabs, but might not know the actual notes on the string the software offers a great transition from counting frets to thinking about the notes you are playing in terms of chords. A great asset when trying to play unfamiliar music without tablature.<br /><br />The software is a great addition to the arsenal, and offers an amazing transition into chords if you are not used to playing them. It offers all this with a rock background, keeping the practice from becoming too repetitive or boring and allowing you to practice music that sounds like a real song."
5,I have been using this software for over 20 years. In addition to the check book I track all my mutual funds. It is fun to watch the values increase but not so fun to have watched it decrease during the 2008-2010.
1,"I'm sorry but it wasn't what I thought it was, and it was difficult to understand. Just misunderstood."
5,I have been trying to find a copy of this program for a while it functions better than Microsoft and provides features that I love with this program. If you have every used SmartSuites before this version works well with Windows 7 haven't had any problems
3,"To start, this is a great product. Naturally, you'll want the best price. Amazon normally is the place. In this case, I ordered from one of the Amazon vendors (not yet rated, but if nobody uses them, how will they get rated?) I have a client that needed this product(I own it and recommended it to him), so I ordered it, trying to save him a few bucks. End result - I never got the product, never got an explanation nor an apology and nothing from Amazon either. I just got a credit on my credit card, so no, it didn't cost me anything except that to meet my obligations, I had to run to the retail store and purchase this. Instead of saving my client a couple of bucks, it cost him extra (and it cost me some credibility). I would have eaten the $50 extra, but my client would have none of that. What a guy, huh?"
1,"If you're reading this because you googled \\""string id insertion failed\\"", \\""65536 already used as a key\\"", or \\""the tax return you selected cannot be loaded\\"", then welcome to the club. The bad news (it's short) is that your data file is toast and you'll have to restart... I've used H&R Block software (used to be TaxCut) for around ten years now. Been pleased all that time. 2010 was a complicated tax year for me, and man, was I glad to be able to use software to get it done. LOTS of forms, calculations, etc. (three \\""businesses\\"", a home sale/repurchase, and some unusual stock profits), but after a couple dozen hours I had it all entered and then used the e-file option for both state and federal. Submitted both and the program was happy. It even allowed me to \\""check the status\\"" even though I had just a few minutes before done the e-file. Everything worked. Easy-peasy. Then I closed the program. Sigh. That's when my trouble began. About a half-hour later, thought I'd reopen the file to check something. Program came up, file listing on the opening screen came up. But when I clicked on the file to open it I received a dialog box with the dreaded message reiterated in the first paragraph of this review. Slight feeling of panic welled up. Tried again. Same message. Closed program and reopened. Tried to open the program. Same message. Rebooted computer, opened program, same message. Sigh. Called customer support. Pleasant but ignorant CSR tried to find solution using her computer. Slowly asked me to repeat error message. I guess she was googling it using HRB's database. Hey, I can do that, what do I need her for? Came up with zip. Asked to put me on hold so she could talk to someone more knowledgable. Came back and gave me the \\""file is toast\\"" message. Fume mode on. Didn't rip her up (wasn't her fault), but told her how unsatisfactory the situation was. Spewed for a bit, thanked her, then hung up. Lucky me. I ran a back up the night before and had essentially the samefile saved which was uncorrupted. Copied it over and modified the name to distinguish it from the original and it opened just fine. Unfortunately, it wasn't the file that had the e-file information in it, so I can no longer use the program to check for e-file status (that ability was lost with the integrity of the original file), but can use the HRB web site to check e-file status. Thank God I had a backup. But I'll seriously consider going over to TurboTax next year. I quit TT ten years ago when they surreptitiously installed some anti-piracy garbage along with their program (by default - no choice on the user's part) and it played havoc with my system. Took me a dozen hours to fix things, and they later came out and publicly admitted this approach was a mistake. But I had resolved to go to a competitor (TaxCut) next time around. Now that ten years have passed and H&R Block @ Home (nee TaxCut) has screwed this file integrity thing up I'll reconsider TurboTax next year. Considering the investment in time to enter the information, and the criticality of financial records in general, why didn't HRB simply have an automagic backup routine built into the program?"
5,Exactly what i wanted. Came as you would hope and quickly too. I would certainly order again from here again.
4,"Haven't gotten past 1st few lessons, but the technique looks solid and the price was 1/10 of Rose Stone. Glad I didn't drop the extra dollars, not sure when I'll get around to spending some real time with this."
4,Working good so far. Didn't understand about the shipping cost.
5,"I remember growing up playing games like \\""The Amazon Trail 3rd Edition.\\"" The first time I got it was from a cereal box. I installed it on my computer, expecting a very lame educational game, but I was presented with an adventure of epic proportions. As a kid, this was the coolest thing I had ever played at the time. Even as an adult, I purchased a copy of the CD and spent hours playing through it. It was more of a nostalgic feel than anything, but nonetheless, it was a great buy. There are some glitches and \\""cheats\\"" that I've learned from playing it. Like, how you can get an infinite supply of food, go backwards in the game, etc. If you love adventure games, learning, nostalgia, or just want to get your kids to learn something, pick up a copy of this game."
5,I'm using this product on my Mac to run Microsoft Office Suite and Microsoft Project for IT classes. It was easy to download and install and has run without a hitch. I would highly recommend this product.
5,"My family used Kaspersky in 2011; we were impressed with the protection it provided and didn't hesitate with our decision to use Kaspersky in 2012. The installation of Kaspersky 2012 was quick and easy; it took about ten minutes. Kaspersky 2012 erased the 2011 version without issue. It was a seamless installation process.<br /><br />One of the nice things that we found about Kaspersky is that remaining days left on your old license count toward the new version. We still had 30 days left on our 2011 program and the 30 days will be added on to the year that we receive with the 2012 version. Essentially, the user is not \\""jipped\\"" - you get all the days that you paid for even though you are installing new software.<br /><br />There are far too many features in the program to rehash here, but it's safe to say that Kaspersky has every tool you would ever need to lock down a Windows 7 PC and many you will never even use. What makes Kaspersky really stand above its peers are the following three points:<br /><br />1) Detection ability -- Kaspersky is always at the top of independent lab reviews for scanning ability.<br /><br />2) System usage -- Kaspersky has a very small memory footprint and CPU demands. It's almost unnoticeable even when running multiple programs in multiple windows.<br /><br />3) Easy to use interface -- I liked the 2011 interface more than the 2012, but it's still very intuitive and user friendly. The automatic defaults mean that 95% of people will never have to touch a setting.<br /><br />Overall, Kaspersky is the leader among security software and anyone thinking of Kaspersky should start with the Internet Security package. It combines every feature you need with top performing detection ability and minimal resource usage. This product is highly recommended."
5,"This game was fantastic! It had plenty of suspects, loads of things to do, many locations, and several people to talk to. It moved along very well, and had suspense and an interesting story line. Myself and three of my children absolutely loved this one. It's one of the best ones yet! We love the challenge of puzzles within the games, and sure, this one didn't have many, but the overall game play, graphics, and storyline more than made up for that. This one was awesome!"
5,"Easily provides the results you need. With profit & loss at the push of a button and a built-in calculator in the check registers, it is one of my favorite programs."
1,Did not woke
4,I have used Turbo Tax for several years and always found it to be a very useful and productive tool. I rate it highly and recommend it's use greatly.
5,"Everything seems to work fine. Upgrading was NOT stressful, old applications ran fine. Using it primarily for iWeb website and iPhoto."
5,"I had an issue with my laptop locking up after a few minutes. An IT friend of mine looked at it and found that my laptop was filled with spyware...despite the fact that I had McAfee. He fixed the laptop and insisted I get Norton 360. I purchased and installed it a few weeks ago. It was easy to install and no problems since! It's worth the investment. If I didn't have someone to fix my laptop, it would have cost me over $100 to fix it. Although...I still owe my friend dinner... :-)"
3,I did not get the Pro version and instead got standard. The only reason I wanted it was to do floorplans. There are no shapes catalogs in this version to do floor plans of any complexity.
2,"price was great, delivery was awesome, but the product in my opinion is not up to the standards of previouos norton products. Have relied on norton for many years, and no problems. now have this loaded on all 3 of my computers and laptops. different settings turn themselves off for no apparent reason and you have to keep your eyes open for the warning that you're not protected, and most recently, my desktop was attacked by the 'dept. of justice' virus that compromised my registry and will now cost to have the operating system reinstalled and the virus removed....Before that, I had trouble loading it on my laptop, so i called the norton 24x7 help line. the technician took control of my laptop and said i need to install some update (sorry, not real techy), he proceeded to install, my laptop crashed, he couldn't get it to reboot and it will be needing repair as well..way to go, norton! Oh, and by the way norton's response to both incidents was 'so sorry'. so much for reliable 24x7 support!"
5,"I have used TurboTax for more than a decade, and have been a TurboTax Beta tester (Win/Intel) for the last several years. I have been impressed with the team's continued efforts to make a difficult and often confusing process as simple and seamless as possible. Being a beta tester I know the team puts a great deal of effort into understanding common use cases and addressing issues that may be confusing to users. Keep up the great work Intuit!"
5,"Bought this for 6 yr old at Christmas - she has been playing on and off since then and still enjoys it very much. I wan't sure if it would get old fast, but even the 7 yr old sister enjoys playing."
1,"The dirty little Intuit (Quicken) secret is that if you don't purchase an upgrade AT LEAST every 3 years Intuit will NOT support the product without their $25.95 fee per phone call, nor will they provide the unlock code if you have to reinstall it for any reason, AND your financial data may not accurately successfully migrate to the later version if you wait more than 3 years to upgrade. When I had to reinstall Intuit Deluxe 2006 and requested my unlock code, the Intuit rep (from India?) suggested instead that I either buy their newest version or enter the blackhole of their customer service via email (which I had already done AND regret - a real time waster). My advice is to choose another financial software, especially if you're a first time user/buyer."
5,This is an excellent seller. I received my purchase within 3 days and it was just what I wanted. I would not hesitate to buy from this seller again and highly recommend anyone doing business with him.
4,The UNO game is not the standard run of the mill UNO game. You have to go through all this shopping and stuff and that's not much to my liking. The Skip-Bo game gives you a choice of classic Skip-Bo or an adventure one. All in all I'm really glad to have this because I had downloaded the Skip-Bo off from a website and had to wait for advertisements between every game. Now I don't have to. :)
4,"I purchased the newest version of Zonealarm Internet Security Suite (2007)after I learned that my computer had 1000's of spyware on it despite my using free spyware, antivirus, and firewall programs. I bought this program as well as Spysweeper's antispam software (2007) and needless to say my computer is free of anything that can cause my computer to slow down to a non functional crawl, freeze up, or be invaded by unwanted hackers' innovation. No more shall I use the free 'helps' available despite their claims for success. I'd gladly pay (now) the annual licenses for Zonealarm to keep my computer healthy. I had read all of the critics (both positive and negative) about this product and other similar manufacturers products, and I concluded that there is not one single product that exists that pleases 100% of the people 100% of the time. So having used Zonealarm before in the past, considering its pros and cons with this software, being familiar with its format, and considering what my computing needs are, this is truly an excellent product as is the Spysweeper program. The only drawback, thus a 4 star rating, is that the installation was a bit of a hassle being installed onto Windows XP, until I learned from Microsoft's website how to get around the problem. The reason I purchased Spysweeper's anti-spyware software, is because it was recommended to me as the #1 means to combatting against spyware. So I have it, like an addendum to a book, to doubly keep certain my computer will always be clean from spyware. Since this was my primary problem, I most likely overreacted. I suspect Zonealarm Suite is good enough as it has all of the needed programs to protect my computer. For when I run the spysweeper program weekly, it tells me that my computer is 100% free of any spyware. Thus I can conclude that Zonealarm is doing what it was designed to do. As far as speed, my computer runs probably a little slower only because Zone alarm is constantly running 'behind thescenes' keeping my computer free of the [...] that is on the Internet. Since its installation, about 2 months now, it has blocked thousands of spyware, adware, and viral attempts. I am willing to have a bit of an operation slow down for that kind of peace of mind!"
3,"I'm just an everyday user. I use my laptop to check email, surf the web, watch movies, nothing extraordinary. I'll be honest, I upgraded to Windows 7 Ultimate because my college offers it at a bargain price. I don't do very complicated things with my laptop, so all the little technicalities that are supposedly awful with Vista didn't affect me too much. There are quite a few things that are redeeming with this OS. My favorite feature is the snap function. I do a lot of multitasking and this feature is incredible. Saves time, works seamlessly. I like how the gadgets aren't limited to the sides of the desktop and can be moved around everywhere. The themes are fairly cool and you can also make your own desktop background slideshow. UAC is nowhere near as obnoxious. Overall, it does boot faster than Vista, so no complaints there. Mostly everything works. Wireless works. My printers and external hard drives work. The actual process of upgrading was easy. I popped the disc in and it did its thing. I'm lukewarm on the new taskbar format. I loved it at first, but it's annoying if you're working with multiple windows of the same program. You must hover over the button on the taskbar in order to show all the windows that are running in that one program. There is about a half-second lag between when you hover and when the little screens pop up. It saves space for those who work with many, many windows simultaneously as it combines all of the windows from one program into one button, essentially. However, there is a way to go back to the traditional taskbar, and I opted to do that. Additionally, you must download your run-of-the-mill basic software (photo gallery, Windows Mail) from Microsoft or other places because Windoes 7 got rid of them. That part wasn't a big deal. My biggest gripe with Windows 7 is HDMI. The audio does not transfer over to the television, ladies and gentlemen. You're stuck using your built-in PC speakers or plugging in a set of external speakersout of the headphone jack. The video appears just fine, but there is no sound!!! The worst part is, this functioned perfectly well in Vista. Apparently you need to upgrade your video/sound drivers according to Microsoft, but there is yet a solution for this problem. If anyone knows how to fix this, please let me know. I've researched this topic endlessly. Type in \\""windows 7 hdmi no audio\\"" or something of the sort in google and you will see that I'm not the only one with this problem. Extremely frustrating! Also, some of my special function keys aren't working. I've spent countless hours downloading drivers and fiddling around trying to get this to work, but nada. I would honestly wait. It's slightly better than Vista, but not $200 better. And if you're a frequent user of HDMI, you might want to stick with XP or Vista until they figure this out. ---- EDIT ---- I bought a new hard drive and did a clean install of W7 Ultimate on it. Needless to say, my laptop is definitely running a lot more smoothly now. All of my laptop's special keys finally work. HDMI audio works now, but you have to enter the sound settings in the control panel and set the hdmi output as your default sound every single time you want to use it. Still irritating, but at least I don't have to rely on external speakers. I've discovered that you must do a clean install and then download the appropriate W7 drivers from your computer manufacturer's website. Simply doing an in-place install and then downloading the drivers will not do the trick, as I learned months ago. If you are considering W7 Ultimate, definitely format your hard drive, do a clean install, and then download drivers. It's a pain initially, but it's worth the effort. I'm keeping the rating to 3 stars, because the in-place install is worthless."
5,"very impressed with ESET. I've used quite a few other competitive products, but ESET gets my nod, as well as most other IT managers I work with. Very light on resources, and does it's job well. ESET support is also good."
2,"I've been satisfied with the features, but Kaspersky slows my computer and internet connection so much that sometimes I have to shut it down in order to avoid waiting 10 minutes for a web page to load. I used McAfee last year and it didn't slow my machine at all compared to Kaspersky. And, they only offer a 14 day return period, so I guess my loss! I think I'm going to try one of the free antivirus programs that doesn't use so much of my PC's juice to run."
5,"I switched to a MAC recently, and had to find an alternative to MS Money for my register and budget needs. I tried everything that had a trial period, and also Quicken. Quicken was a flop- I asked for a refund within 24 hours. Then I found YNAB- it is simple, and the budget tool is far more powerful than I was using on MSMoney. In comparison, Quicken does not even have a budget tool when compared to YNAB. I have been using it for several months now, and it is simply fantastic. It has improved my own budget skills, and I have been at this for more than a decade."
5,"I've bought both ENCARTA and BRITANNICA for years. This is my opinion:<BR>TEXT: The Britannica is a superb encyclopaedia in text since 1768. If only its electronic version were worthy of it! Text in the electronic version is different from Printed Encyclopaedia (large articles have been shortened). Britannica claims that it has more articles than Encarta, but this is a joke: articles like \\""Spain\\"" are only one with a lot of subdivisions in Encarta, while in Britannica subdivisions are considered articles, and you must \\""jump\\"" from one subdivision to other.<BR>In some areas Encarta is better than Britannica. For example consider &quot;controversial events in modern history&quot; such us \\""My Lai Massacre\\"": In Encarta one large article and a lot of mentions in others; Britannica does not even know the name.<BR>In theory, you can update Britannica over the Internet free for a year quarterly (4 times), but this does not work. Encarta is updated free EVERY WEEK) with new articles and additions to the old ones. The new articles and additions are included in the next version of Encarta, but this is not true for Britannica. For instance: \\""Bilbao, Spain\\"": Britannica does not mention the Guggenheim Museum, which opened in 1997, and the population is !!estimated!! of 1982. The same article in Encarta: similar text, 3 photos, 1 map, related articles, sidebar, dynamic timelines and 4 internet pages, plus one specific article \\""Bilbao Guggenheim Museum\\"". I think Britannica updates its contents very slow, whereas Encarta is completely alive.<BR>MULTIMEDIA: They say that \\""serious\\"" or \\""adult\\"" readers do not care about \\""pictures\\""; that multimedia is only for kids. I do not agree, because I think that, sometimes, \\""A picture is worth a thousand words\\"". Works of art, anatomy, maps, diagrams ... Encarta devastates Britannica with a lot of photos, paintings, drawings, maps, animations, interactivities, videos, music and sounds, pictures, literature sidebars, new translation dictionaries (not very good though), atlas, 2-D and 3-D virtual tours, timeline, games ... It's not only the quantity and quality. It is the easy access you have to all the multimedia, and that text and multimedia are fully integrated. Britannica's Atlas is a joke and statistics do not exist or I have not found them. Encarta's has a great detail: 1 cm/ 4 km all over the world (though you find some mistakes) and hundreds of statistical maps.<BR>INTERFACE AND SOFTWARE: This is the worst side of Britannica. In Encarta you only have to type a phrase, a word or the beginning of a word to see all the articles and multimedia that contain it. If you have typed the name of a small village, you see it in the Atlas without clicking again. If Encarta does not find anything, it gives you alternative spellings and you find what you were looking for. To go \\""jumping\\"" from article to article is very easy and quick, because you have a lot of links and the \\""Related Articles\\"" section. If you need to copy text or pictures, the integration with Microsoft WORD is perfect. If you don't understand a word, you can double-click it and the dictionary appears in a window.<BR>Navigating with Britannica is different. You get crazy. I will only give an example: if you do not know the exact and correct spelling of a name or word, it does not help you with alternative or similar spellings. The dictionary does not permit double-clicking of words in the text of articles for their definitions. Once an article is displayed you cannot search for a word within the article. This is extremely annoying: you have to perform this task yourself. One \\""pro\\"" for Britannica: they say it works with Macintosh computers.<BR>This is my piece of advice: If you can afford it, buy both. If not... read again this review."
5,"Its really easy to Its really easy to use! I worked with the very first Roxio, the makers of LivPix when it first came out. Now there has NEVER been a program since LivPix that has worked as well for editing pictures. It was the VERY BEST. The first Roxio program was simple and easy to use. Now they've came out with this pro version and the slide show is awesome to use."
5,Received item as described. Saved over $25 buying at the next cheapest store at Walmart. Uploaded to laptop without any issues.
5,This is an excelent Chess program but a little above my skill level. I keep playing it to get better but it keeps getting harder if I beat it and I don't beat it often. Sam Jones
5,"I purchased NIS 2008 after reading some reviews and found that it runs good on my system without taking up unnecessary resources or bogging it down. Install was straight-forward although the program itself has a few quirks and minor setbacks. Ie. setting a custom scan with the antivirus program takes some figuring out and a full system scan isn't run unless you go into this option and ask for it. Otherwise, I am happy with the program so far and haven't found any real setbacks."
5,Just getting content aware is wonderful. Add to that the ability to have it identify and correct for the camera & lens used in Camera Raw. The new brush shapes and color pallet mixer is a benefit.
5,"This is the first year I have used Turbo Tax and I can say it has been above and beyond easy. My sister talked me into using it, as she has used it for years. My tax preparer has retired so I wasn't quite sure where to turn to next. So flawless, the hardest thing was organizing all the forms or waiting to receive them in the mail or email. I am very organized so it was the waiting that was hard.<br />So happy with the decision to use this."
3,"There is an extensive amount of basic information included with this, though as many others have stated much of it can be found online. What is nice with this is that it is all in one place but you may find it takes a bit to get used to navigating through the menus. Having the Nolo books included is great as their publications are always high quality and contain good information. The dated look this program has when you pull it up made me knock off a few stars as it doesn't really give the appearance of being all that current and makes you wonder how current the material is, even though it says 2013. If you are looking for very basic forms and contracts and are somewhat unfamiliar with business forms such as these this would be a good resource, particularly for someone getting started with a small business for the first time."
1,"Am I ever GLAD I read these reviews.<br />Looks like Intuit is up to their old games again.<br />Remember the Rootkit anti-piracy program with TurboTax in 2003?<br />I certainly don't blame the software engineers (Dilberts) - - they have to kowtow to (Bad Name 1) pointy haired bosses who derive new ways to HOSE their customers. Now TurboTax 2008 will charge you $9.95 to print more than one tax return!! And the SAME (Bad Name 2) at Intuit have taken GIANT steps backwards with QuickBooks 2009.<br />WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH INTUIT.<br />Looks like I'm going to have to go back to TaxCut this year, and give a serious look at SWITCHING TO PEACHTREE for my Accounting needs.<br />I've already decided NEVER to buy another GM automobile (after my 98 GrandPrix GTP spontaneously started an ENGINE FIRE - a KNOWN defect with NO RECALL WARNING). This is AT LEAST the second time we've been HOSED by Intuit - - time to THROW the BA-----S OUT.<br />So how do I REALLY feel?? :-)<br />Merlin<br />(Post edited to remove the (Bad Names) :-)"
1,ONE time load w/o paying again and it is more $$$. Your computer crashes too bad...get a newer computer too bad... not really &#34;your&#34; program even though you purchase it. It is a good program though...just don't have any problems...

5,"I use both mac and PCs, and this is my favorite Os ever. Not trying to start a Mac vs PC war. Each has its pros and cons. There were times when I preferred a Mac Os over Windows. It all depends on what kind of work you do, how you like to do it, and what features are most important to you. Both platforms will be around for a very long time, because each one has plenty of fans."
5,"UPDATE:<br />Back when there was only 5 reviews of version 12, 2 reviewers gave this product 1 star, thus giving the impression of \\""Buyer Beware!\\""<br />This was quite puzzling after I had done research on this as a quality product.<br />Thus, I purchased the product, and wrote the following \\""review\\"", which I later updated, below the original.<br />If someone was researching what Amazon reviews said about the product, and thus read the negative reviews,<br />I wanted to reassure them I was ordering this without hesitation!<br />Also, there was a lot of strong evidence, it was a superior product, at a comparitively low price!<br />( No I don't work for Sony. see my other reviews.)<br />Thus my original review:<br /><br />OK, don't be put off by the low scores. Perhaps because, so far, there are few reviews?<br />I researched and have purchased this from Amazon. I think my decision is reasonable.<br />I have yet to receive it by mail. Am I taking a chance? Sure, but the evidence shines through to the positive.<br />Of course I will update my 4 star rating up or down, once I recieve it and use it a bit.<br />I rated 4 stars because, I didn't want to put more people off, from seriously considering this product.<br /><br />Here's the logic;<br />1.) This software is exactly the same as version 11, with the exception of being 64 bit and it can be adjusted to use popular brand GPUs.<br /> In other words, some one familiar with version 11 sees very little difference in the layout except some additional plugins.<br /> Version 11 has a nice user base, and a good rating from people who use it.<br /> Users of lower versions of this product, who have upgraded to this 64 bit version have reported a huge difference in speed. Look for yourself.<br /><br />2.) Version 12 \\""stand alone\\"", has a good rating right here on Amazon. This suite IS version 12 stand alone, with additional programs included!<br /> Judge the ratings by viewing Music Studio Platinum 12. But also check out version 11's reviews. Look elsewhere besides Amazon for more reviews.<br /><br />3.) Included with the \\""stand alone\\"" version of \\""Music Studio Platinum 12\\"", is \\""Sound Forge Audio 10\\"".<br /> This also is a stand-alone program that seemlessly melds into the video program.<br /> The 2 combined stand alone prices, are well above the Suite price. Check it out.<br /> I already own and use Sony's Acid Pro 7, and the layout of both Sony products in Movie Studio PL 12 have the same work flow.<br /><br />4.) I have asked questions about this product from a certain person who makes instuctional videos on how to use this and other \\""Sony Vegas\\"" incarnations.<br /> His videos are easily found on the internet.<br /> I asked him about the compatability between the suites 64 bit Movie Studio, and the 32 bit Sound forge.( I bet you never thought of that! )<br /> He explained, Both programs are working with manipulating files. And they work together very well.<br /> A 64 bit program or a 32 bit program, do not change an MP3 file into 32 bit or 64 bit! Video files are the same!<br /> He explained that it has to do with speed. Music files are small. So a 32 bits is fast for rendering music.<br /> Rendering even complex music files, is nothing compared to rendering video. Especially the video Movie Studio is capable of producing. Thus 64 bit is an upgrade!<br /><br /> Yes this is \\""Sony VEGAS Music Studio HD Platinum Production Suite 12\\"". Sony just decided to remove the words \\""Vegas\\"", \\""HD\\"", and \\""Production\\"".<br />I will update my opinion, as soon as I receive and use the product. I may have to eat Humble Pie, but I don't let that deter me from what I expect to be a good upgrade<br />after mastering Windows Movie Maker. LOL!<br />Let's Face it, most people examining this product are looking to upgrade from something simpler, but they're not looking for something as complex as \\""full on\\"" Premier or Vegas.<br /><br />Secondary review: I was not surprised when I recieved Sony Movie StudioPlatinum 12 Suite, that it was what I expected, and more.<br />The main disk includes 3 Sony stand alone programs, that can be purchased separately at a higher cost.<br />1.)

1,"This product is not accurately represented by the manufacturer. It is nearly impossible to contact their 24/7 customer support. You CANNOT contact support through the process of loading software. There is no telephone number listed any where in their loading process or site-map nor is there a way to engage in a 'chat' because when the software doesn't load properly you don't have that option. One must get online (without antivirus protection) to attempt to locate contact information and once you finally find the number through a separate website and call, you will be put on terminal 'hold'. Upon loading the software my compter immediately locked up. The CD could not be removed. Afer several reboots I was able to finally remove the CD. I would never recommend this product no matter what reveiws it has gotten. I returned the software the next day for a refund."
1,Was extremely disappointed. Disks did not work in my Mac computer and I even ordered set for Mac. I am used to Clipart program through internet and it is so easy to work with but have to pay $125.00 per year. Was looking to save some $ but have decided to renew my subscription to Clipart.
5,"Having bought and installed every version of Windows this installation and upgrade (from Windows Home XP) was the smoothest. Microsoft's Beta testing appears to have been very successful. By the way, I am just an average home computer user. <br /> <br />Vista first inventories the software and hardware and indexes whatever files are needed for the transfer. Then it installs, which took about an hour in my case on a Celeron D CPU at 2.13 Megahertz and a little over 1G of memory, with the standard Dell-Intel graphics chips (not exactly a high-end computer). <br /> <br />The look and feel and the interfaces and integration of Vista with other software is awesome. The software has killer diagnostic tools that are a cut above the usual third party software algorithms--for example, Vista remembers what has been tried and tells you so if you try to repeat a recommended \\""fix\\"". I liked, and installed two \\""gadgets\\"" in the left sidebar--a floating office--style clock and a calendar. <br /> <br />All the software on my machine functioned after the install and reboot, even software Vista identified as possibly not working--in my case, the Intellipoint mouse software. It did work just fine. <br /> <br />The install did kill my broadband internet connection for a brief time; and after going 'round and 'round with the idiots at Adelphia/Comcast customer service--who stated that company modems did not work with Vista, and that they are not ready to offer help for their customer running Vista (do not believe them)--I fixed the connection after discovering (through a Vista diagnostic tool) that competing firewalls from Windows Security Center and Windows Live One Care were blocking inbound streams. <br /> <br />In fact, Vista has a very nice feature in its Windows Security Center (that helped me fix my broadband connectivity) which tells you when you have competing security features enabled. In my case, it was two firewalls, one of which (Windows Live One Care), wasset to \\""restricted\\"". When I removed this firewall, and left the Security Center firewall enabled everything worked perfectly. <br /> <br />By the way, despite what I read elsewhere, my iTunes runs smoothly. I also have lots of third party software (defraggers, spy removal software, password software, etc.) on my computer, and all of it, except the well-known buggy and unstable System Mechanic 7, operates without problems, and did so without having to download \\""patches\\"". <br /> <br />I believe Microsoft did a great job on producing and testing Vista. I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to move beyond XP. <br />"
4,We got this for my 11 year-old for Christmas. We the option for him to use 3 different options from basic options to expert options he is able to use it easily. As he gets older he can learn more advanced things in the program. It was a wonderful option to get him away from video games!
1,"Man what a problem this software created. Upon installation it deleted my very well running copy of Norton's Antivirus 2004. My system was slowed down so much it was like having an old 286 processor again. The crashes were mounting and \\""customer no support\\"" if you can find it on the site was absolutely no help at all. Had to uninstall the product which is when I found the Antivirus Ver 4. was gone and I had no virus protection. Then to top everything off I dug out the AV 4. disk and found it had been cracked. Naturally Symantec refused to help resolve the problem I would not have had if I had not installed AV 2005. Every time I tried to tell the software that an email was not spam it would lock up the system requiring a re-boot. <br /> <br />AV 2005 is gone and is my AV ver.4 Still waiting on credit from them on my credit card. Purchasing a competitors product even though I have used Norton's since they first came out. <br /> <br />THIS SOFTWARE IS GARBAGE........ DO NOT BUY IT AND IF YOU DID DO NOT INSTALL IT. Much better off keeping ver. 4 and keeping your subscription unless like me you cannot replace AV Ver. 4. and you are simply screwed."
1,"The key value of this product is the ability to sync large or many files across machines. I travel a lot, so being able to synchronize my laptop files with my office and home workstation is the whole point of Laplink Gold. You can imagine, then, my horror at finding that this product does not work with my laptop: Dell Latitude CS 400XT. Plug in the USB cable, and the system hard resets! Very nasty.<br />Back in November 2000, the online support admitted that \\""other problems with laptops have been reported\\"", and they would contact me with details of a patch as soon as one is available. I have heard nothing to date. Furthermore, their website makes no mention of laptops that do or don't work with this product. No mind for the customer. They just take your money, and fob you off.<br />When added to the USB cable price, the entire package costs around $200, but provides no value at all. To all prospective purchasers: BE CAREFUL (or be ready to demand your money back)."
5,"I am fairly new to bookkeeping and completely new to QB. I am the office personnel for a rural church. Our needs differ from most businesses. Our purpose and our tax regulations don't fit the mold of a typical non-profit foundation either. These unique differences make the bulk of the training videos and manuals very tedious and confusing to adapt in a practical way. I could not have deciphered and used the product without the amazing techs that are available, patient, kind, enjoyable, and efficient. They have taught me the best way to accomplish my goals. I did watch the videos and have a manual and they have been very helpful, but the final breakthroughs usually come with the help of a tech."
1,"This is another terrible product by InfoUsa. For a small business trying to extract information for mailing lists it's a waste of time and money. It's even worse than SelectPhone, which used to be a terrific software package. You can't extract more than 1000 names at a time, it's hard to use, nothing is co-ordinated for the user. They lie on their promotion and packaging. Nothing works. Don't waste money on ProCD either. I'm trying to find a software program like this that actually works"
4,"My friends persuaded me that I didn't need to spend $ on my accountant for basic deductions (mortgage, second home loan, charities, work expenses, etc.) and that TurboTax was user- friendly and just as effective. For the most part, TurboTax lived up to my expectations. However, as a first-time user, I made a few mistakes (didn't have all of my wife's documentation and I lost a charity receipt that I had recorded in my computer records) so I had to resubmit. I hoped that, since I found these errors just minutes after submitting my TurboTax for direct bank deposit, that I could start all over again without amending my taxes and having to print out the amendment and having to send it snail mail to the IRS and state. I was wrong. Once you submit your results, you have to amend any caught mistakes no matter how soon after, which can put a red flag on your finances and catch the attention of the IRS and state. I've never been audited and the very thought is troubling indeed. Next year I will use TurboTax again but I will make sure I have dotted every \\""i\\"" and crossed every \\""t\\"" before I submit my final results. I hope my lesson can be of value to others and spare them unnecessary anxieties."
5,"Can't do without it. It used to support 3 users, but now just one. Oh well. I can't do without WORD anymore. I can do without Microsoft, but not without WORD, and this actually works better - inserting images that is.."
4,interesting but no disk
5,Not as good as windows '98 but it does what I need it to 11/10 would recommended
5,"I recently discovered that this great consumer software - Easy Media Creator 7 - that I use for my own personal and family fun could also be used for some of my work projects. Not everyone in the world has PowerPoint, and if they do, they may not have the same fonts installed on their PC as the slideshow you are trying to share with them, etc. So creating and sharing slideshows that everyone can view can be a challenge. I just got back from attending a conference and trade show last week where I took a bunch of pictures. In no time I downloaded them and turned them into an annotated and audio narrated slideshow using Creator 7. I then had our Webmaster post it on our Intranet site and now co-workers from around the world can watch a quick summary of my show observations. It made me look like a star at work!"
5,No problems with software installation and my computer runs smoothe. The 360 Program did not slow-up my computer.
3,"As with all of my Amazon purchases to date, overall service is 5 stars. I start the review with this, because I purchased the product as an unwilling participant. I've been a QB user for at least twelve years and have upgraded the product based on a willingness to upgrade and improve my accounting systems. This upgrade has me a little more than annoyed as it was an unwilling upgrade. As many have felt, the current economy has all businesses scrambling to save themselves financially. QB decided their current subscribers needed to upgrade their entire accounting system in order to cure a systems security issue with their online mail and credit card processing, in-lieu-of a security patch. The minimum cost to upgrade is appx. $230.00+++. While $230.00 may not seem like a lot of money when spread over the years, when times are tight $20.00 seems to have value again. Without the upgrade, my business would have come to a creep with the discontinued abilities to electronically bill or send e-mails. Since the QB system is all proprietary, a user cannot cut-n-paste an invoice to send over their own private e-mail systems with the older versions, it requires the use of QB to accomplish this through the QB servers. That's the bad side. The good side is, QB now allows the use of private e-mail v. going through the QB servers to e-mail invoices, with a small hitch, QB asks for the e-mail password every time an e-mail billing or statement is sent through private e-mail. If there is a \\""remember me\\"" command, I cannot find it in the set-up or help links. The new QB look and feel is better than ever, just as easy to use as before, with the added benefit of not having to use their server to electronically send invoices. Overall I'm pleased with the product, the timing was very bad and didn't allow for a planned purchase. Less than a months warning was given that the older version would expire and rendered useless for what I required. Amazon receives even more credit for hosting a great price, 1/3 the cost elsewhere, as well as delivering as promised."
5,"Product was priced well, it was delivered on time and works as well or better than the Turbo Tax soft ware I have used in the past."
2,This cord worked well for the first few months but then developed a loose connection and broke. Poor quality it seems.
5,"Saved my life, as I had miss &#34;lent&#34; mine. Arrived quickly and safely. THANKS!!"
5,Product was as advertised and arrived on time.
5,overpriced but easy to obtain & use
5,I reviewed several programs and finally settled on Cook'n. It is easy to use and the updates just keep making it better. I have used their technical services several times and they have always been quick to respond and answered every question I had. They helped me resolve several issues with the program quickly and easily. I would highly recommend this software to keep your recipes organized and accessible on your smartphones and pads.
2,"This program is way too difficult to use. To begin with, it never could access my bank accounts in order to merge the information. Unless you have several accounts, investments, tons of debtors and have absolutely no organizational skills, this program is a waste of time and money."
3,"I have version 2.0 for Mac and bought 4.0 pro so that my wife could have an easier time e-mailing photos. <br />The e-mailing utility works great, but it doesn't store mails you've sent for later review and it doesn't allow for easy viewing of pictures you're selecting for mailing.<br />The print feature also works much better, or at least it did until I treid using it under OS 9.2.2. Under OS X things worked fine, but I had to downgrade for other reasons and have been unable to print to my HP Photosmart ever since. Their tech support was not very supportive. Anyway, when it was working it made much more efficient use of paper and it allowed you to select photos from multiple different directories, unlike the previous version.<br />However, what I liked about the old version was that it was drag-and-drop friendly. It was easier to transfer files between directories this way, and so it is infinitely harder to organize photos under version 4.0. <br />Generally, it seems that whoever wrote the software wasn't completely familiar with Macs. A lot of the convenient and powerful shortcuts we Mac folks use are not served by this program.<br />If I had to do it over again I wouldn't buy it. If they work out the above-mentioned bugs soon, though, then it's worth it."
5,"That's right, Uncle Forry was indirectly responsible for this and the developers say so on the box and booklet inside. This has a drive-in 1950's scifi feel to it. You can tell this was a labor of love. You get to play as several huge monsters with different destructive powers, a brain, a 50ft woman, a floating eyeball, a godzilla type lizard etc destroying a city. Each level, the cities get bigger and bigger and pretty soon youre battling big jets dropping bombs on you as well. At one point you're attacking a small desert town with a drive in movie theater!! I'd happily pay [...] for this w/o batting a eyelash and you can get it here for a couple of bucks...do it!! Buy this game, you wont be sorry!! If you love 50's scifi, attack of the 50ft woman, brain from planet arous, godzilla, attack of the crab monsters etc then this is a must buy!!"
5,"I've used it to clone two disks -- both system disks, one XP aand one Vista -- with no problems at all. The backups that I do with it go smoothly as well."
1,"After reading the reviews on Turbo Tax Deluxe 2014 dropping schedules C & D and charging more, I've decided to switch to H&R Block Deluxe software. Its cheaper, downloads Turbo Tax files from the previous year and is highly recommended. I've been a Turbo Tax user for seventeen years and this was the last straw."
3,"I use this for school, writing essays and sending them to prof's... and I'm having a heck of a time having word 07 \\""talk\\"" to other versions of word, if I attatch an essay and send it to my comp from school, I have problems getting it to send on to another prof.. I wish the bugs were worked out before purchasing. I'm not the only student having issues with word 07 and getting their work to their prof.s.."
5,The software was as advertised and the mail delivery was very quick.
5,Every year I do an upgrade and every year I get the Norton Antivirus. Don't have any problems with it.
2,"The delivery of the product was fast and efficient. The software was not a retail copy, but a bundled CD from some other software or hardware that is illegal to be sold separately."
4,"I run this program on a reasonably powerful computer (1.2 Athlon) with no problems but a slight delay booting up (perhaps this might translate into a freeze on a less powerful computer). Encarta might be more kid friendly, but don't forget the depth and quality of Britannica's content (after all it has been the premier reference for eons and it's all there on the DVD). I know style counts for something when it comes to the software interface, but don't forget the content, particularly if you're over 13!"
5,"Great for beginners and intermediates! I purchased this cd-rom for a very fair price. Since downloading it and going through a few of the sections I find this simply amazing! First, I think Keith Wyatt is an excellent teacher, specifically via DVD. He appears throughout the sections of this cd-rom. Second, this cd-rom has EVERYTHING! If you're into the blues and learning how not only to play but where the playing derived from, this is definitely for you. You can go to specific riffs and then click on icons to get the lowdown on scales, modes, etc... It tells you the history, the methods and the uses for everything. Awesome! This program has a virtual fretboard that you can slow/speed as it plays. It loops and sections off whatever parts you feel you need to look at again. It shows actual videos of Wyatt playing or teaching as well as computerized methods. There's too much to list as to what this can do for you. I love it already and I've hardly delved into the meat of it all. What I like so far is that this cd-rom teaches you what the blues is. If you want to pick up a guitar and become a rock and roll god overnight this is not for you. But if you want to learn a little something about the heart and soul of The Blues this is definitely a fantastic tool for your blues education and training. I highly suggest paying the small price for something like this. It's fun and, if you take the time, can really teach you some great things on the guitar."
1,"I have a number of machines that I manage with this product installed. They worked great on previous version of PC-Cillin until I installed pc-cillin Internet Security 2007, then every thing RAN SLOW... It also gobbles up huge amounts of RAM. I have 1GB RAM and all of my systems become progressively slower as the day goes on. After one day of being powered on the computer is useless as it is too slow and idles with ~600MB RAM used when not doing anything. This 2007 program seems to have become some kind of virus itself... DO NOT BUY! I will start moving my machines over to something else."
5,"Love it, Microsoft makes great product. I really like the new features and the way it looks. 5 stars...."

4,had some experience with HTML design of web sites but found this much better for my needs. it took me a little longer and a few trials to get it going but now feel confident using the progrm.
4,This product has worked well for my pc. No issues with compatibility; it has kept my computer virus free.
1,"After installing the software, all attempts to activate it failed. Following instructions in two emails from Nuance, More attempts failed because of \\""microphone/sound test failure.\\"" Local computer testing indicated microphone and sound were both working fine. I requested a phone number from Nuance in order to resolve the problem on a more timely basis. However, receiving no response for days from them, I returned the software to Amazon, who promptly refunded its cost. The problem was with Nuance tech support, not Amazon."
2,"I think the McAfee product is OK if you can load it.<br />Instructions are not correct. Web site is not designed to help.<br />This will take more time than it is worth, Other products may be a better option."
1,"I bought every year's TurboTax without looking at reviews or features, based on many years of good will from excellent software. Never again. Many reviewers mentioned the problem with product activation that prevents you from filing amended returns if you or the IRS decides you need to. That alone makes TurboTax completely unsuitable for use. A second problem I haven't seen mentioned is that it will not run under Win4Lin (runs Windows applications under Linux) and I don't want to reboot to Windows-only just to run the tax software. But thank goodness I installed TurboTax only under the Win4Lin virtual Windows which I can rebuild fairly easily. If I had installed it on my native PC and C-Dilla had modified my Master Boot Record, who knows if I would ever be able to repair my computer? *DANGER* stay away from this program!"
1,I am a 20 year AutoCAD user. I was tempted by the new AutoCAD interface for TurboCAD. It still aint AutoCAD. Save your pennies and buy the real thing. Frustrating as hell. TurboCAD is just a blood vessel waiting to pop!
5,"I recently started my own business - my first try at it - and after speaking with many people I know who own small businesses, I went with QuickBooks. Almost everyone I spoke to uses it. I know there are other bookkeeping/accounting software products out there, but I have no point of reference with which to judge them. Than being said, I think QuickBooks has been really good for doing what I need it to do. I have a simple, one-man business with no payroll responsibilities. After some time with Qickbooks, I would be able to offer a more accurate critique, but so far it has been great."
3,The price was reasonable and installation was easy. I'm not a big fan of Norton but I trust this more than most of the other products out there.
5,"as pictured, fast delivery"
1,"The charitable deductions section does not work properly. Trying to input both a car donation and household items has sent it into a tizzy. It starts asking for cost basis on the household items as well as the cars. In the subwindows, it decides that all the household items were cars also and asks for 1098C info on those. Incredibly frustrating."
5,"I had this game when I was a in second grade, and now, with my baby girl going into the second grade, i got this for her. She's having the same amount of fun with it that I did!!"
1,Cheap version of a date book. Not worth it to pay to return it. Cheap Waste of money. DONT BUY.
5,"My son took a course last trimester in High School on Home Design and got into it big time. He was always excited to show us and his relatives his latest house plans he had drawn. He even drew his Uncle's Cabin from memory and gave him a copy of the plans. This last Christmas We bought him a program for his laptop in hopes that he would spend more time doing something constructive instead of playing HALO all the time. The High School had been using the top of the line version of Home Designer but I bought the HGTV version for him for Christmas. It was not very user friendly, hard to use and had an instruction manual about 300 pages thick. We got a refund. Ordered the Hime Designer Suite here on Amazon and now I'm even getting into this! Very easy to use and a lot of fun! Highly recommend it."
5,I have found the product easy to use and would recommend it to others.
4,"The quicken home and business is a lot more than I wanted, but I was replacing a 2002 Quicken and the 2010 has what I needed."
3,"Not very happy with the product. If you must run QuickBooks, you will want to run the Windows version via Parallels or similar. QuickBooks for Mac lacks even basic functionality that should be included."
4,"I've used Tubo Tax Delux for several years to prepare my tax return. This years edition was the easiest to use ever. Amazon offered the best price, even better than SAMs and BJ'S."
4,"Below is my original review (2 STARS). just days after this was posted and after hounding Encore and Broderbund (who make this software) SOMETHING HAPPENED! The tech team at Encore (Broderbund) just created an update to fix a glitch in their VERY big seler Print Shop Professional 3.5. The update is version 3.5.3 and it solves a number of issues including the hateful blurry \\""HEADLINE\\"" problem it was having until this latest. I just updated mine and checked it out... IT'S A FIX! So I raised my review to 4 out of 5 (it still has a few minor problems, but really... sort of trivial by comparison.).<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />I was able to do so much with Broderbund's Print Master Platinum 12 and so disappointed when they ran that product line right into the wall.... for scrapbooking (almost exclusively). So much of what that software could do was lost and the newer version of --> [[ASIN:B00EXPSVJK Encore Software The Print Shop Professional 3.5]] was where those features ostensibly were expected to resurface. However...<br /> Nowhere in the documentation either on their own website (where I purchased this product) or as a disclaimer during the order process does it mention a fatal flaw that is present in all PSP 3.5 (Print Shop Pro 3.5) incarnations. EVEN the newest ones on disc - THE HEADLINE FEATURE IS UNUSABLE!! Yes all headlines when using this software are blurred and at times illegible That's right, they are selling an otherwise dandy piece of tech gear, but if you need the Headline Feature, you are S.O.L As a result of this tactical negligence, I spent the better part of today/last night trying to find a cure for the heasdline problem, A cure which, sadly, does not exist at present<br /> Oh, and don't bother with the 3.5.2 \\""update\\"" . That too, does NOT work. A fact that has been acknowledged only in their pro user forums, the last words on which are to use another program to design a headline, save it as a JPG file and use it AS A GRAPHIC!... ..Unfortunately, it must be said, The PSP 3.5 is a bona-fide P.O.S."
5,"Seems easier to use than the past few years, it is easier to move around and obtain information you need quickly."
1,"Just to mention, didnt' realize this was 2007, installed it and don't know how to use it...hate Microsoft!!!! Sick of them changing stuff so much that you have to go to school to use something you've been using since 1998!!!! So...I bought a 2000 version. When did America start allowing monopolies again? I thought that was a thing of the past???"
1,Purchased online from Nero...<br />Crashed my Amd 6 core ssd boot disc.<br />12meg ram....system.<br />Crashed my HIS 7700 video card drivers 4 times...<br />REmoved the program and went back to nero 8 two frustrating hours later...<br />Requested a refund and was met with a robot response that quoted company policy....<br /><br />So look for Nero Stinkers on Facebook<br /><br />My SN for the product is listed on the nero site on facebook for anyone to have for free<br />as I will never see my 39.99 ever again.<br /><br />Thank you and dont forget to run the other way as fast as you can from Nero 12.5...<br />I think it is related to that beast that lives under your bed and has from the time you were a small child<br />and got your own bedroom...if you buy this it will reside under your mattress and come out at night and<br />rip your soul from your body.<br /><br />Good luck.
4,"I liked this software because in my daily work, there are many times I need to create or revise a pdf doc. This software saved me time in having to retype a doc."
5,"I bought this software before my latest hunting expedition to Montana with my son. I brought along my laptop and was able to log every single aspect of the hunt. It allowed me to track the stats and pictures of each days successes, and captured the photos and field notes that will help me forever remember this Elk hunt with my son."
5,I was rather concerned when I read some of the reviews about the Family Tree Maker. I called and spoke with their customer service representative who explained it has been updated to fix the message that sometimes came up saying the records were also lost on ancestry.com. She explained when I load the disc into my computer if it is one of the earlier 2012 versions a message will pop up saying you must update. I did that and it downloaded my ancestry family trees beautifully and quickly. (I do have one terabyte of storage.) I made sure to register when prompted and that did grant me the free three month subscription to the U.S. search records. I wanted the family treemaker so I will still be able to view all of the original source documents when my three month subscription is over. I also like the ability to create stories and books utilizing the information in the Family Tree Maker. I am very happy with the automatic sync feature between the records on ancestry.com and family tree! P.S. I love the Ancestry.com phone app!!
5,"I have an iMac running OSX, and a Windows computer, all in one thanks to Parallels Desktop 9. I already had a recently purchased MS Windows Office Suite, and a Quicken upgrade, when I decided to go with iMAC and OSX for my next computer system. I was NOT looking forward to repeating those purchases! Parallels to the rescue! Buying Parallels and Windows 7 was much less expensive than buying those two items for MAC! And Parallels does work seamlessly; I can be using MAC software, and immediately open a Windows file, without giving it another thought. Way to go, Parallels!"
1,I have been using nero last 5-6 years wanted to give this a try. Cannot even sense my DVD writer. Cannot even uninstall .. no such facility for windows 7 home premium. Reinstalling windows to clean this out and install nero back No way to give anything below 1 star
5,"We have been using quicken for years, it great for recording your investments! We are able to track day to day."
3,"I've been using Photoshop Element and Album since 1.0. <br /> <br />Contrary to what you may think, PE 3 is NOT Album 2.0 bundled with the image editor. It is one huge app with different intrinsic components: editor and browser. <br /> <br />Album 2.0 was good enough for my needs (pics and video clips cataloguing) but lacked a critical feature: watched folders (found in Picasa and ACDSEE). PE 3 has this feature, thus my decision to upgrade. <br /> <br />Below are the major issues I've been having with PE 3 are: <br />====================================== <br />1- Video clips catalog is busted: only small clips are recognized while Sony 640x480 30fps clips show up as broken thumbnails. This worksd fine with Album 2.0. <br /> <br />2- Because of the above problem, the Browser is extremely slow to the point to appear being frozen. I had no choice but to disable 'Video' as an authorized media type...This alone is a showstopper for me. <br /> <br />3- Sluggish performance: launching and switching between editor and browser is slow (I have a P4 2G, 768MB RAM, nVidia GeForce ti 4200 with 64MB video card, WinXP Pro SP2) <br /> <br />If I wanted to catalog pics only, I'd use Miocrosoft Digital Suite, which is by far the faster app, not to mention the EXIF support wich is awesome (keywords are actually saved in the picture itself!) <br /> <br />Now because I need to tag video clips and pics, I'll be buying ACDSEE v.7.0. My friend ahs it and it is a great product: fast, video, pics and music cataloging. Their keywords is using a tree-like structure which is not as elegant as Adobe's tagging mechanism, but I'll live... <br /> <br />Hope that review helps. <br />p.s. In case you are wondering, I've purchased PE 3.0 for Windows from the Adobe store ten days ago."
5,"I bought this through Amazon. You better be a student because you have to open the box in order to get your product code. There's also a paper that gives you a link to verify student status for adobe software that has NOT been purchased directly through the Adobe website. I scanned and sent my documents and got my approval and new serial number the next day. If you are not yet registered for school, you can still install the software and use it as the trial option for 30 days."
4,"The backup/retore features of this work grear with Windows 7 64Bit, but the clone feature is another issue. so far they have failed to get the cloning feather to work, perhaps because of the new AFD formate used on the new hard-drives?"
5,A little learning curve but it will back up my data
3,"The price was great and I have been happy with AutoCAD LT. However, I have not been able to load Revit LT on my computer. I asked Autodesk if it would run on my machine before my purchase and I was told yes. I tried to resolve this through my Autodesk subscription, which is supposed to provide technical support, but I have not received any help from Autodesk in solving my problem."
5,Great price for a great product. Thanks.
5,"I purchased the only book on EW3 that Barnes & Noble had in their local store. It only covered the basics and was no help at all. I returned it and ordered Expression Web 3 in 24 hours. This book is highly informative and provides a \\""hands on\\"" learning approach. It is the best EW3 learning resource that you will find."
5,I concur with the initial reviewer. Roman spends enough time so that you have a feel for the openings. An excellent video in comparison with the Polgar videos (which are the only other ones I own).
4,"I've been playing around with this app for the last month and have found that it fits solidly in that space between photo-editing software and full-fledged graphics design software.<br /><br />What I mean by that statement is that this software offers a lot of creative capability - far more than an application like [[ASIN:B00EOQZB0A Adobe Photoshop Elements]]. Having said that, the additional capabilities come at the cost of increased complexity & cost, which means most casual users won't even consider it.<br /><br />In our case, we were considering using Painter instead of the full-blown [[ASIN:B007USG3OC Adobe Photoshop]]. All-in-all, this is an excellent replacement; but, it turns out that X3 does not support vector graphics. It won't even open existing vector files - which is a deal breaker for us.<br /><br />Overall, I would say that Painter X3 has a good interface and a lot of potential for people who want to move to the 'next level' when it comes to digital creativity. As long as you don't need vector support, I suspect this will fit the bill perfectly."
5,"Great Price - was able to redeem my discover card cash back to get even more bang for the buck<br /><br />Free Shipping with Tracking - Nothing beats it<br /><br />On Time Delivery - Makes it very satisfying to get it on time ( after going through a wait of 2 weeks to receive the same software from another on line merchant, and not hearing from them or being able to contact them that led to canceling the order via my credit card, the importance of on time delivery becomes paramount)<br /><br />Software - Perfect! that is what I was looking for. Everything went off well - from the installation to the the actual performance. I was able to install it on my 2004 Dell Dimension and thus avoid buying a new computer ( even as some folks from Dell service and one of the local software store guys told me that Windows 7 would not work/ not work very well on my 2004 Dell Dimension)"
5,Iolo's System Mechanic is a great software package. I have been using it for years now. My computers have never run so well since I first installed System Mechanic. I highly recommend it to anyone with a Windows PC or laptop. It is a must have item on all my computers. Just give it a try and you will see how it works. ( 5 STARS )!
4,I saw so many great commercials about the program I decided to purchase it. The instructions are very intimidating and challenged me a lot. After trying to perform the functions for many hours I had to give up and contact customer support. The technician was very helpful in getting me through the set. Why those instructions could not have been included eludes me. I am up and running and still having glitches here and there but I am not giving up on the program.
5,"I had a really old version,don't even know the year. This one is much better and the graphics are much better. Husband and I bothe love this version."
2,"I love the idea of Final Draft, more than I ever actually liked final draft itself. I started in this game using CELTX because it was free, I love the collaboration ability, the online nature of the sharing facility, then the scheduling and the storyboard features, aaaaah the good ole' days.<br /><br />But, just like the 'Apple' ideology, you just seem to have to have FD if you want to get on in this world. But for the actual tiny program you get it is full of issues, Ver. 9 crashes all the time, older scripts almost NEVER open properly, the workarounds are laughable (seriously, a release version software that needs workarounds??) and the whole &#34;what version is this?&#34; question that professionals have to ask each other now is utterly ridiculous.<br /><br />The size of this thing should run on a PC from the 90's, let alone on a quad core beast I currently use.<br /><br />If it wasn't for the fact that the industry almost 'requires' you have this dinosaur, I know most would use something else.<br /><br />With version 9 they've really hit a Windows Vista moment, they fixed what wasn't broke, I think their time is coming to an end and they have literally shot themselves in the foot.<br /><br />This morning an older draft of a script froze my work machine for about 30 minutes at which point I had to restart, and whilst typing a moment ago I looked up and the damned thing is about ten words behind (and I'm no speed typist I can tell you!)<br /><br />Buggy, slow, almost no changes in the latest version that haven't been available for a decade in other FREE utilities, and for the price I think they should have done so much better, they have a massive fanbase that will halve with this new mess.<br /><br />I think another day or two of this and I'm off back to version 8."
5,"The item was new, in good shape. It really protect my computer against viruses, so I'm more than happy! Thanks!"
2,"If you've seen this program in use and you know in advance what you will be getting, and that's what you want, then go ahead and buy it. Otherwise, exercise extreme caution. It is very powerful and capable. But it is also a very complex piece of software and not easy to learn. I tried it, decided it was several light-years beyond what I wanted, and chose to uninstall it.<br /><br />And that's when the fun started.<br /><br />Pinnacle installs about a dozen different applications when you run its installer. But when you run its uninstaller, it removes only the base application and leaves everything else on your disk--gigabytes worth of software. It took me an entire afternoon with Revo Uninstaller to get my PC back to where it had been beforehand. I had to find all the apps Pinnacle had installed, remove them one by one, and then remove *hundreds* of registry entries and *hundreds* of directories that each app's uninstaller failed to deal with. It was a nightmare and I'm still wondering what I might have missed and what will now fail to work because I deleted something I shouldn't have. It was an unmitigated disaster.<br /><br />I would recommend that if you decide on installing this, that you first create a Windows Restore point. Then, choose the \\""Custom\\"" install and just do the Pinnacle application itself. If you want all the other add-ons and libraries and tools, you can add them later, and if you decide to uninstall, you'll have a much easier time than I did."
5,"Windows 7 Pro is required to join a computer to a domain, and the \\""anytime upgrade\\"" is nothing but a key that unlocks similar funcions that are already built in to Windows 7 Home Premium. A little frustrating that Microsoft holds you to it, but at least Amazon.com has the cheapest price ANYWHERE!"
1,The price for the product is probably the reason it lacks so many of the options the autoCAD Lt has and if you're expecting a home version of the Lt you will be disappointed. I sent it back and will save for a Lt version
3,"I love my Mac and while iPhoto is an awesome program there seem to always be some images that need a little more editing. So, I had a choice of 2 products that I liked. I purchased Pixelmator and while it does a lot of things and can get very involved I was not personally pleased with the software. Seems it is more of a creative tool than a photo editing tool - my opinion. So, I have since purchased Aperture 3 and do prefer it to Pixelmator. The flow of Aperture 3 with iPhoto seems a better match as well. So, download the free trial of Pixelmator before buying as well as the free trial of Aperture 3. Yes, I know Aperture 3 is more expensive but it is an Apple product and again - if you are OK with spending a little more I think you will be happier with Aperture 3 than Pixelmator. Also, the support with Pixelmator was less than good. No response to the 2nd email sent after attempting to do something suggested to me by their support."
5,"I can't believe how many people have written negative reviews of this product. I have had very little difficulty and have not yet downloaded the update. Just to test my premesis, I installed the program on an older HP P3 computer with XP but with less memory and speed than with my new Sony VAIO. It made a huge difference and I suspect that people having ther stated difficulties just don't have a sufficiently powerful machine to deal with this very bulky program. It is working very well for me in producing family history videos with mixed movie clips from captured video, photos (digital and scanned prints), clip art, voice over narration, MP3 overla, sound effects, etc. I'm considering starting a hobby business creating family DVD's. <br />Good Luck!"
1,"I purchased this for a Russian speaker. No where in the description does it say \\""for Spanish speakers ONLY\\""! What a waste of time and money, simply because they can't accurately describe the product. Simply trying to install the product, your first hint is all the installation dialogues are in Spanish! I'm going to assume somewhere on the box (IN SPANISH) it says for Spanish speakers only. I don't read Spanish, thanks for no help at all with your packaging and description."
4,I didn't want to go to windows 8 based on reviews. Installation wasn't that easy but resolved problems with help from Microsoft Forum
5,"I was searching for older software for my 1.33 GHz iBook G4, and ran into this family pack (5 users) of iLife 08'. It had a great price at 6.44 overall, and within about 2 hours of ordering the item, I discovered it had already shipped! I had VERY fast shipping, and didn't take even half the estimated time! The software worked flawlessly, not to mention being in absolutely great condition. It even came with a trial version of iWork 08' as well, which was great. Everything was included as advertised. Bottom line: I would definitely recommend this seller to a friend."
4,"I installed it on a Windows 7 laptop that is less than a year old. The software install went fine. I plugged in the included USB device and Windows installed the driver. Based on other reviews I asked the software to get updates. There weren't any. I fired up the VHS, selected the edit button because I want to save the videos to a hard drive. I can always burn them to DVD later. I started the capture and saved a 40 minute video to disk. it took about 2.5 gig of disk space. I did stop most other applications and did nothing on the laptop while the recording completed. I read most of the other reviews posted for this product. I have an idea why some folks may have had so much trouble with it. This kind of application can be CPU intensive and if folks were trying to do almost anything else on a typical PC they probably caused enough interrupts that the software just gave up trying to process the incoming tape stream and burn it to DVD at the same time.

4,"I researched movie editors for months, before buying Sony Vegas Movie Studio 9 Platinum Pro Pack. Did I make the right choice? Yes, however this product is only usable if you have good general computer skills, and have the ability to learn through trial and error. I would not recommend this product if you expect to produce a masterpiece in one day.<br />What do you get in this package?<br />Vegas Movie Studio Platinum 9 - program to edit digital movie, add soundtracks, voice-overs, and fancy text, rolling credits, etc.<br />DVD Architect Studio - program to author DVD's, so you end up with professional quality DVD menus with all the bells and whistles<br />Sound Forge Audio Studio - a music editing program, with the added ability to convert all your L.P.'s and cassettes into digital format, so that you can then make CD's or load them onto your IPod.<br />Cinescore Studio 1.0 - free music of various genres, to add to your productions to give them a professional sound<br /><br />There was one major problem with this software when I first loaded it, that I only managed to fix by pure luck. The problem was quite a major one. In the version which comes on CD-ROM, there is a bug which stops the soundtrack from MPEG2 files from loading into the editior program. This is incredible considering that almost every digital camcorder on the market uses the MPEG2 format, including Sony. However!!! Once you have loaded the program and registered, you need to go to the Sony update software web page. Here you will find a download that fixes many bugs in the program, including the MPEG2 problem.<br />There is another problem with the program if you are going to buying this to upload videos to You Tube. In the last couple of months You Tube has upgraded there video screen to Widescreen (16:9 ratio) format. There is no template in Vegas Movie Studio to handle this. So if you intend on uploading video to You Tube in 16:9, then you will need some advanced computer skills to create your own template. I'm sure Sony will work on this and provide an update to the program in time. At the moment, the program handles traditional 4:3 format for upload to the internet.<br /><br />There are many cool features hidden within Sony Vegas Movie Studio 9 Platinum Pro Pack. Only the basics are discussed in the instructional booklets that come with the program.

1,norton has greatly slowed down my computer . not liking it very much.
3,"Every year I hope they will simplify the questions, and every year it gets longer. The software will ask a yes or no question and then query 3-4 more questions, even if the first answer was negative. VERY ANNOYING! I am sure they want to get &#34;every possible deduction&#34;, but I am pretty sure if I have foreign investments or own additional homes, just trust me and lets go on! I hope that the results of the &#34;audit&#34; in the software are accurate, as by the time I get through, it has managed to ask questions that make no sense and help is non existent or dumber than the question as to what they are even talking about. I miss Parsons. Just let me fill out the forms and help if needed, thank you. Please make it easier for the 99% of us that have a simple income from one state."
5,"This product is easy and fun to use. The games are fun and really keep you intereted in learning more. You learn to type very quickly with this. I haven't finished it yet, but so far it is an excellent teaching tool. Once you have learned all the lessons, then you start building on speed."
4,"Purchased to import my older Photo catalogue (after a computer crash) that would not import into my current Elements 9. Import worked fine. Interface is considerably different from 9, not as convenient to use for tags, which is the main reason I use the photo organizer for my 10,000+ photos."
1,"... i've had friendlier virus infections. had to create a new partition and reinstall OS and move my files before i could finally undo the damage and rid the computer of the \\""program\\"". goodbye symantec."
5,"Pimsleur is just great to learn to speak and get the good accent. It is expensive but worth every penny ( of course you can also buy the MP3 and download them directly on your PC, it is cheaper.....sorry Amazon). 30 half an hour lessons it's just the minimum to give you an idea about the language. You will need other books to go on studying the eastern Arabic dialect. But this course is a good introduction and you will acquire a good pronunciation. I regret that Pimsleur doesn't furnish the script."
1,"Installed this program on PC /Windows 7, and tried registering it through the listed tel. number. After a long wait, the extremely rude representative told me the program wasn't designed for windows 7 and that I couldn't use the stock templates, which was all I wanted the program for. Note thet Windows 7 is listed as one of the accepted operating systems. He tried to pressure me into buying their new software. I wouldn't buy anything again from this bunch of flakes!!"
2,I cannot use the application because it requires higher resolution screen. I'm using a netbook and the program won't download on a smaller screen so that's kind of disappointing.
3,program freezes ocassionally
4,"I was very satisfied with the supplier. Contact and delivery information were excellent and the product arrived in the time promised. However, it was very difficult working with Office 2007 and I actually had to contact my computer's manufacturer to assist with getting the software uploaded onto my desktop. I have not yet had the time needed to seek similar assistance from my laptop's maker. Excellent service from the supplier, but maybe the Microsoft corporation is too big..."
5,This worked great for me. I had a problem in the beginning and thought it was the upgrade but it turned out to be my computer settings. Now I am in the swing of things!
1,"Well I had a failing disk, but still working and under (Dell) warantee. So how to back up my system so when the Dell man came and put a new disk in? Mayne I could recover in minutes/hours/days (it took days). I delayed the install until I could get an external disk and install Acronis. I backed up twice (maybe 3 times). I used every thing I could including just copy and paste my file (this worked best)over to the external disk. <br /> <br />The great day came and !! Dell installs a naked disk (no os, no nothing) but, hay, I had no worries I had Acronis (you can now read: dog doo). <br /> <br />I restored the total system and got the message \\""Windows could not start because of a disk hardware <br />> configuration problem. Could not read from selected boot disk. Check <br />> boot path and disk hardware.. <br />> <br />And after writing to Acronis i got a long BS message saying I should have had a different product. <br /> <br />NET maybe this is not a really BAD product but what's really unforgivable about a backup product is that they lied about what it could do. BTW their message was signed: <br /> <br />\\""We are always at your service should you have any further questions. <br /> <br />Thank you. <br />-- <br />Best regards, <br />Alexander Gladkov <br /> <br />Acronis, Inc. <br />52 3rd Avenue <br />Burlington, MA 01803 USA"
4,"Not as good as an instructor class, where you can ask questions, but the next best thing. Very well done."
4,"I have used TT on and off since the DOS version. I abandoned it for TacAct about five years ago when TT had trouble running on a virgin Win XP install. I would have stayed with Taxact if they had a Mac version. Given this, the product worked flawlessly and did a good job of walking one thru the 2009 return. One flaw was it stated it would import TaxAct from last year - it does not! I guess since TaxAct had no previous version for the Mac they did not think anyone on the Mac would need it - wrong! All in all it did a good job."
5,OMG I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS. My son is in a Spanish immersion school he's 7 so its good for any age . Both of my children as well as myself will be using this program. I plan on buying the entire visual link package. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I would love if they would create a box of flashcards so my children could use as study aides.BUY THIS.
5,Was easy to load on my computer and works well. Has lots of good games. I have a Vista system and had no trouble installing.
1,"I have this software installed on my machine, and was somewhat satisfied with it until I started having activation problems. Even bios updates appear to cause failure, and you can spend considerable time apologizing, hat in hand, asking for a new activation for software that you supposedly own. Imagine needing this tool in the middle of a project, and then discovering that it won't work, simply because you swapped out a drive for a larger one. I have the Adobe CS5 Master Suite, and in spite of the fact that it costs about 70 times as much, and is much more likely to be pirated, it does not seem to have these activation problems. I strongly urge you not to buy this product or any other for which the issuing company is far more concerned about theft of their product than they are in making it usable for their paying customers."
2,"I found Adobe Photoshop Elements to be much better suited to my needs AND easier to use based on my experience and amateur familiarity with older versions of Photoshop. I needed a newer version of Photoshop to be able to handle the &#34;raw&#34; images from my then new Canon EOS T3i. I read many, many reviews of both Lightroom and Elements written by amateurs and professionals. To be honest, it was difficult for me to understand the difference between the two software packages. My son-in-law is comfortable with Lightroom and uses it well, so I tried it. I found it to be vastly different from previous generations of the full Photoshop software. Even after trying it, I am not certain I understand the differences. The major difference MAY BE that Lightroom allows across the board corrections and modifications over many images at once, whereas Elements allows image by image manipulation. Without extensive reading, study and tutorials, I had difficulty figuring out how to work on a single image at a time with Lightroom. I did use Lightroom successfully to create a slide show fairly easily. But this can be done with several software packages.<br /><br />In the end, I uninstalled and sold Lightroom and replaced it with Elements 11."
1,"Couldn't even load program... Get an error message \\""product more then 15 months old. Cannot load. Please by update version\\""<br /><br />Total waste of money!! Going to have a very disappointed little boy tomorrow. Promised him he could have my spare laptop after I put stuff on it to help keep him safe."
5,"Corel Painter 11 (old version) is spot on for what I was looking for. I have an older Powermac G5 and was hoping to get the latest version of Painter that would run well on my system. This fit the need perfect. I was using PhotoShop to digitally paint artwork and was ok with the results even though it was inefficient and tasking, but am now way happier with the results and ease of use Painter has placed at my hands. I strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a digital painting or freehand style drawing program that is responsive and adaptive with high quality features, but can't use or afford the newest version. Amazon gave me the best price and information I needed to make the most logical and cost effective choice when I did my research. Thanks Amazon and thanks Corel for keeping older versions of products available as well as the newest."

5,"Having had the same experience with Rosetta Stone as many of the reviewers here have described, I went in search of an alternative program that would give me the tools to say more than \\""The horse runs\\"" and \\""The man eats rice\\"" (Rosetta Stone is quite enjoyable, but better for vocab than for anything you can actually utilize in real life). I came across Fluenz, tried out the online demo and was hooked. I was amazed at the amount of info that stuck, even after one lesson. I completed level one in 3 weeks, which is probably faster than recommended, however, I looked forward to working on the lessons each day, and often had to stop myself from doing too many lessons at a time. I'm now in the middle of Level 2 and I'm starting to think in French. I'm often surprised at the number of structures I can put together (OK, some faster than others). The program is structured so that each lesson builds on the last and the explanations during the tutorial sessions are invaluable. Additional practice sessions on the audio CD's and podcasts help to further hammer the information into your brain. There's also a Facebook page that allows you to communicate with other Fluenz users and an additional site called the \\""Fluenz Commons\\"", where newly developed flashcards are available. iPhone and iPad apps are on the way. I haven't needed to contact customer service, but based on other reviews, it's great. And no, I don't work for Fluenz. Just a very happy customer. If you're hesitating to purchase this, don't. It's the best $500 I've spent recently. Fluenz is a sleek, effective program, and most importantly, if you have realistic expectations and are willing to put in the time and effort required, it works."
5,"I have been waffling back and force between another major suite and this one for a few years. Always found the other product to be a major resource hog. Norton 2011 and 2012 have been fine on all my systems, from XP through 7 Pro. No issues with installation either. So far, so good!"
4,"I've used the past few versions of Adobe Photoshop Elements and I really enjoy using it. You can clean up or manipulate your images in a lot of different ways. Photos don't always come out of the camera looking great, but it's fun and rewarding to make them look great using the tools in PSE10. I do wish that some of the effects weren't so cartoon-like, but that's a minor quibble.<br /><br />A bigger problem with PSE10 is that the Organizer still has problems importing my photos. The import fails the same way PSE9 did. Because I can't use the Organizer at all, I only use Photoshop Elements as a photo editor and use Google's free Picasa program as my organizer. I'm not sure how much I would've liked Organizer, but I'm not that disappointed since Picasa is very, very good.<br /><br />I've run PSE10 on both a Windows 7 64-bit PC and Mac OS X 10.6.8 without any crashes or performance issues."
5,I have been using this program to complete my taxes for 10+ years. It just keeps getting better and easier to use. I highly recommend it.
5,"I have been using Parallels 8 on my new Macbook Pro (the June 2012 model, dual core i5 processor) for over a month now, and have had exactly zero problems so far. I didn't expect this because I used to run Parallels 6 on an older Intel iMac in the past and that gave me nothing but trouble (horrible performance being problem number 1). Windows XP, Windows 7 and Windows 8 all run on my Macbook Pro as they should. The reason I decided to give Parallels 8 a try is because of its supposed higher speed and stability over VMware 5 and previous versions of Parallels.<br /><br />Windows 8 is speedy enough on my machine that games from 2003-2005 run effortlessly in a 1600*1200 resolution, as well as various more serious applications. Applications that I frequently run in Parallels are:<br />- both \\""Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic\\"" games (run great but Parallels GPU emulator doesn't support AA or buffer effects)<br />- \\""Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines\\"" (runs flawlessly with the latest unofficial patch from the Patch Scrolls)<br />- MS Office Visio 2010<br />- Several password cracking algorithms (can be quite CPU-intensive)<br />- Several computer forensics applications, such as ProDiscover.<br />- Skyrim and Fallout 3 (were playable at a mix of the lowest and medium settings, don't expect to complete a round of Skyrim or Fallout 3 on a virtualized machine)<br /><br />The Coherence mode works very well, I love using it for running programs with smaller user interfaces like ProDiscover. While in Coherence, you can run individual Windows programs in full-screen, which gives them their own Mac OS Desktop (accessible through \\""CTRL\\"" + \\""up arrow\\""), and which also enables you to flick through your Windows apps with a three-fingered swipe like you would in Mac OS 10.8.<br /><br />Finally, I should note that my Macbook Pro contains 16 GB of memory and uses a Corsair Force GT solid state drive, but Parallels ran on my notebook without issues before I performed these upgrades. It's also pretty clear that you would need at *least* 4 GB of memory to run a virtualized Windows 8 instance on top of Mac OS, and you'll find that having anywhere over 4 gigabytes makes a world of difference.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend Parallels 8! The only thing I miss is the ability to enable anti-aliasing in video games, but that is of no consequence anyway."
5,"As usual, this version of TurboTax is very complete and easy to use. It picked up last years information even though I had changed computers and had some file transfer problems. TT is the way to go for a small home business. The only issue I have is really not Intuit's fault, that is I can't efile because the forms for claiming energy credits are not available. I will have to file a hard copy - bummer. This is my third year with TT and I haven't seen another product that comes close. Especially poor is the option to use a local tax preparation service.<br /><br />Jim"
1,"This is a problem these days with software manufactures that they want customers to register software or it cant be used. I know that maybe I am behind the times and still use snail mail which is safer than the internet and if you dont have internet even the program is bought and paid for, you cant use it unless you provide the manufacture your very personal information. This is a racket started by Apple that plugs you into a merchandising network to sell additional products. I resent any type of business that forces individuals to supply personal information or you cant use the program you have paid in full for..<br /><br />Why cant a product just be supplied with a key that activates the product without having to go online and release personal information??<br /><br />Does anyone really believe that manufactures like DXO actually go out of their way to protect"
1,"I have found it very frustrating, from trying to match sentences to the corresponding pictures possibly drawn by children... seriously its like playing pictionary. The first task is to figure out what the picture is trying to represent. The first disk was OK but one of the demonstators spoke so quickly that I could not understand him, the second was like it was from a different system, and even needed different software to run it. The second was not user friendly, you had to click back and forth to advance to the next word, then to get it to speak the word. I did very well in high school French and am usually good with languages, this was no help... actually very irritating to use. I was so irritated that I had to keep clicking away, that I was not concentrating on learning the language. The content could not possibly take you to a conversational level. For $50 I can ask where to get a taxi, or call for an ambulance, and of course where is the bathroom.... wait let me see if I can draw a picture of that . I should have saved the $50 to put toward Rosetta Stone."
4,"this product was a replacement for another Norton 360 program, it work great before And expect no less this time"
2,"This is good if you homeschool and want WORK for your kids, but this is FAR from interactive learning and is not a game at all :("
3,Thanks got here quickly and was what I was wanting thanks againThanks got here quickly and was what I was wanting thanks again
1,A waste of time and money from the word &quot;go&quot;.<br />Operating system is a mess now (W98)...registry files unacessible...initialization errors...compounded errors.<br />But the biggest error was buying it in the first place.<br />If you're a computer geek with a desire to learn what can go wrong- by all means- go ahead.
5,"Other tax software products have come and gone, but Turbo Tax is still my preferred choice. I've used if for many years. Only one problem encountered a few years back (limited the number of times you could use the software), but that was changed quickly. No reason to change as the product still performs well."
4,"I bought this for my wife's new laptop. Installation was easy and works well with Windows 8. We have been using Microsoft Office for as long as I can remember so there were no surprises here. My only complaint is the price. In my opinion, Microsoft is charging far too much for a product that has shown little improvement since Microsoft Office 2000. Unfortunately, Windows 8 requires the newer version of Microsoft Office. Just one more reason why we do not like Windows 8."
5,As expected the product was received on schedule and it was exactly what I was looking for. Installed it and it works fine!
1,"Very Bad Software Keep giving me error message put original dvd in drive.which i did but no luck .after returning it to amazon they sent me a replacement and same error message.contacted fluenz they sent one patch by email but still no luck.how bad $500 software and can't recognize its own disks poor.Other Problem i have is There is no Internal DVD Drive in my mac Airbook or iPad How i can i sue this software and the way technology is changing more & more iPad's,Handhelds or Air Book's Coming This is a Big Problem.

3,Fun game to play. A little older than Guild Wars and doeesn't cost you per month to play like WOW.
4,"My old software doesn't work with windows 7. In stores this product is very costly. I've only used this software once. So far, I am very pleased with it. It'll just take a little time for me to navigate around the many options."
5,"Fast and easy to set up, and it covers five devices. Do far seems to be working flawlessly without causing any issues in accessability."
5,I got this for my 2 year old laptop that is in ok shape a last year and it is so awesome! It does exactly what it said it does. It actually saved my pc a couple times from virus attacks! I love webroot and i always will.
5,Accurate and easy to use tax preparation software. I highly recommend TurboTax. I have used it for many years and have always found it to work well. All my questions are answered.
5,"Delphi is the best all around tool i've used. You can do everything you can do in C++ and it's so easy. It's learning curve is almost the same one to learn Visual Basic. Delphi creates standalone executable without dlls, and your applications run since the first time like they are supposed to do. Ask anybody from VB to know the problems with VB.<br />You can create apps, web server extensions, dlls, ActiveX Objects and ActiveX dlls, Control Panel applets, your own controls and much more. You have tons of components, and you can get more tons of them for free at the web.<br />The standard version doesn't have database components, so you should get instead the Pro or Enterprise version, although you can import the MSADO library and use it the same way you use it at VB.<br />Delphi is what MS wants the .NET platform to be.<br />Highly recommended. It's sad that a lot of managers select VB without even considering other tools like Delphi, but if you know Delphi you will finish your projects before the others using VB and your app will run smoothly since the first time."
5,"This is THE game for all adventure game lovers! It's a very old game so the graphics aren't great, but it's a ton of fun. The puzzles in the game range from easy to extremely difficult but thanks to the internet, the hard ones can be solved :) I definitely recommend this game, as well as all other games in the Zork series (though the first three are text based so i don't personally enjoy them too much)"
1,"Bottom Line: It doesn't work. I tried it with 3 different VCRs and 2 different computers. The fact is that it would record the audio but never once could it record the video without being nonstop jumpy. Nothing in the manual, nor through the company support fixed the issue. It has basically turned out to be a fifty dollar piece of garbage. Avoid it like the plague, and pay a professional to convert your VHS tapes."
5,Just as described
3,It's a good way to brush up on your math skills and it's very easy to navigate. I'm happy with this product.
1,"THIS PROGRAM WAS COPIED RIGHTED IN 1996/ IT WOULD NOT LOAD ON WINDOWS 2000. Recommended DOS 5 Or Win. 3.1..... 386 Processor~ 4Mb RAM. I did not know this program was THIS OLD. Keep your money. If you want this copy , you can find it in the trash!!!!! I'd been better off buying a book."
1,"I borrowed my friends Surface for the weekend and found it truly appalling. First of all, it's much heavier than a comparable tablet. Its display also seems to have worse resolution than even a 1st gen iPad. The battery life is terrible compared to other tablets and the keyboard is clunky.<br /><br />Now the really bad news, you have very little control of the tablet. Anything you do basically has to go thru microsoft. They are going to track everything you do online ans sell it to advertisers. You can't even see what all spyware is running because microsoft disabled the Task Manager.<br /><br />If all you want to do is screw around on facebook, go ahead and drop 700. bucks on one of these iPad wannabees. Myself, I would rather have a nice laptop for that money that can actually be used for productivity. Nice try microsoft, but if you want to sell all my information off to the highest bidder, you could have at least charged less for an inferior product."
5,"For ten bucks, you get about 25 games on one dvd. Awesome! Been playing \\""Jewel Quest\\"" only so far but very pleased with disc overall. (Had a weird issue with having to reinstall Jewel Quest every time I play... probably didn't install correctly originally. Not a big deal though)"
5,"In honesty, I couldn't live without this software. I am a composer and songwriter. Finale allows me to arrange scores and hear it back. I'm not a concert pianist, but I can still hear my creations played flawlessly."
5,"This game is so amazing because it brings the otome games to the PCs!!! Cuz of it, now I don't have to play otome games in a PSP, I can play it in any computer with windows XP,7,Vista in Japanese!"
4,"I own both the IMSI (FloorPlan 3D Version 5) and Punch (Architect 4000) software titles, and the following are my own conclusions. I have no vested interest in either manufacturer. I have a doctorate in Mechanical Engineering, and have taught interactive computer graphics, so I guess I am more than usually familiar with computers and design. <br /> <br />I designed my previous home using the IMSI package, and after using it to capture the design, I passed it along to a draftsman to create drawings for the permitting process. I found that the package was easy to use (although a bit weird), and that it generally worked great. When we moved in, the home was absolutely spectacular! So, when we moved to another state to retire, we decided to repeat the process. Even though I still had the IMSI software (Version 5) and it readily installed onto XP, I thought that surely there had been improvements. So, I took the time to find the \\""best package out there\\"". The reviews I read said that the Punch (Architect 4000) package was rated best, had the most features, blah, blah, blah. So I bought it, in spite of paying approximately 3X what I would pay for the latest IMSI version of FloorPlan 3D. The manual is about an inch thick, but I started wading through, thinking that this was the learning cost of a really good package. The manual seemed reasonable and there are TONS of features (read complexity), but when I actually tried to use the program, I couldn't get anything done. Everything was hard to do. Then, and this was the killer for me, whenever I saved data, I could never read the file back in. I tried everything, and eventually thought that it was my fault, so I went back to my old IMSI package because I had a house to design. <br /> <br />I quickly got up to speed because IMSI wins out hands down for its simple user interface. I struggled with both initially, but soon found that IMSI's wall layout tool, while weird, was useable. It's ease of use (tailorable wall heights, pushing even non-rectilinear wall segments around, changing wall thicknesses, immediate demonstration of dimensions and room square footage, changing wall and floor materials, colors, and texture, etc) allowed one to work pretty quickly. I was never able to use Punch's layout editor efficiently. Ever! Forget saving the data so you could work on a design again. Even just creating a simple layout was a huge struggle. Unless you knew the design beforehand, it was very difficult to lay out a floor plan interactively. This was what IMSI was good at. Even with a fully designed floorplan, I had trouble with the Punch program. <br /> <br />IMSI was also the easiest in viewing your design in 3D. Again, the viewing tools were weird and somewhat non-intuitive, but eventually useful. Punch's 3D viewer was totally useless, and I was never able to control the views, no matter what I did. And, \\""Hey!\\"", I taught computer graphics. <br /> <br />After spending many hours getting a complete design (from my working with IMSI) entered into a freshly-reloaded Punch, I again tried to save my work. When I went back to work on it some more, it was unreadable. The file was there, but there was some formatting error that made it unreadable. I was furious, but thankfully, I had the IMSI design captured. So, I had a decision- Waste more time trying to debug a program I had paid 3X more for than the IMSI FloorPlan 3D, or spend my time getting work done on my house plan. Actually, I downloaded a free upgrade to Version 5.1 and got busy. Now I am thinking of purchasing IMSI's Version 11 as I am finalizing our house plan and like some of the new features and abilities of the new software. <br /> <br />To be candid, neither software package was bug-free. IMSI occasionally doesn't allow you to move a wall, but that is almost always because there is some constraint that is disallowing the modification. I found Punch to be even more restrictive. While I was able to exportthe IMSI design as a vrml file and e-MAIL it to my son to review, Punch had the greatest number of export file options. Too bad it always lost my saved designs. Neither package really creates beautiful 3D graphics, but IMSI's simple renderings were adequate for previewing the design work. I also liked IMSI's design methods using internal room dimensions. But, neither program made it clear how to proceed in starting a design from scratch. Nowhere did they tell you whether you could design the 2nd floor first, whether you had to layout the foundation beforehand (Punch), etc. <br /> <br />Finally, I should mention that I wanted to input site information for my lot, but that was too costly in terms of time. Interestingly, I downloaded Google's free Sketchup software, imported my IMSI design (in dxf file format), and was able to place it on the terrain using a Sketchup to Google Earth tool, and then interactively view it in 3D on my 10 acre lot using Google Earth. I found out that I have some serious grading and fill work to do on the build site."
5,"was pleasantly surprised, it did what it claimed to do, steps were rather easy to follow, and the wonders that this soft ware can do will blow your mind, part of the fun is learning how to do things only the pros could do, if you start with a good picture this will help turn it into a great picture, and the things you can do with it is almost magical.you can be serious, or you can goof off and have a lot of fun, so far I'm very happy with it and when you call for technical help if you would need to, there are live people who will help you understand and correct your problem. Great product."
1,"I bought the H&R Block Deluxe Federal + State after the fiasco with Turbo Tax and reading the positive comments. I installed the software, did the updates, and started doing my federal and HI state tax returns. Everything seems OK, except that there was no residential energy credits options or questionnaire when I was doing the HI state. Tried calling Customer Service and after being on hold for more than 15 minutes, I hang up. Their Customer Support is lousy. Try reading the blogs and comments on the Community Site. I also tried checking for updates after a few days and there were no planned updates for HI state. I'm anticipating the 35% credit for installing PV solar panels and solar hot water system. So what I am to do. I am not happy with Turbo Tax, but may have to go back and use TT Premier. I hope H&R Block sees this and fix their software, otherwise it's useless to me."
5,"This is an excellent operating system and worth far more than the price. I'm sure nearly everyone has heard of Spotlight by now but I really have to say that it simply works. It's fast and excellent at finding little files hidden all over my hard drive, it makes the Google Desktop software on my Windows PC laughable. Next, with Dashboards' widgets its certainly nice having these all these programs right at your fingertips to find weather, stock quotes, or movie times. Additionally the new programs like Automator and Safari with RSS are also great additions. My computers' overall speed seems a bit faster now, although I have noticed a few bugs they were minimal and should soon be patched. Bottom line is this is a great upgrade."
5,I am a Turbo Tax convert......and I like it!
5,I work for an Automotive Manufacturer which runs an old Order Management System that requires Windows. It does not run on Mac. Parallels is amazing! Windows actually works better on my Mac than it does on my PC. Now I can do everything right on one computer and I can have both operating systems open at the same time in adjacent windows. Genius!
1,Returned it because it didn't work.
5,"Easy to load, easy to use, excellent price, prints out all backup forms.<br />A lot easier to make out your taxes with this software.<br />Would recommend to buythis."
5,"Streets & trips 2008 was a very good buy, at the time. I got it when I was using Windows XP, it also worked with Vista. But, when I went to Windows 7, I lost it. It would not work with Windows 7 so I picked up the 2010 version, which works great with Windows 7. I am finding other programs I have purchased also don't work with Windows 7, but I guess that's to be expected when you move up. Anyways, Streets & Trips 2010 is a great program and well worth<br />the money. Also have a GPS Tom-Tom XXL, which works great with Streets & Trips."
5,"This game is a great little timewaster.<br /><br />Modeled on Diablo, and on Nethack before it, you're an adventurer who, with his trusty dog, will crawl through randomly generated dungeon levels, collecting randomly generated treasure.<br /><br />Nice way to waste some time.<br /><br />The Mac port has a few bugs with sound, but no bugs that interfere with gameplay."
4,"I have been using this Roxio for a few weeks now and at first it was a little confusing to use but once I started understanding how the software works, I have been doing OK with the software."
1,After loading the software we were unable to enter the product ID code in the rosetta stone page to begin use of the classes. I began to wonder if it was our pc but we discovered it was only when using the login screen that most of the digits were not entering at all. I tried copy/pasting but that didn't work nor did restarting my pc worked. We narrowed it down to only the rosetta stone login. Very unhappy with this very expensive software and unfortunately we will have to return it.
2,"What I found wrong with this game is what I find wrong with the whole gutless love love, I embrace the god within you, on the surface, hiding as a corporate marketing ploy to ensnare all those tripped out and fried into buying something \\""hip\\"" and mind expanding before the kava kava wears off and they become born again christians. It was too easy and preachy. And what is up with the wig on the royal falconer? Did Deepak kill Santa? No problems with install. I was even able to play with one arm in a cast.<br /><br />Theodore"
5,"Used the PCmover software/cable to move my software/files to my new computer. Saved me alot of time. A word of caution, when the instructions say turn off your firewall(s), you must do it or this software won't work. Well worth the price of the product."
3,"PSE8 for Mac is great for all the reasons covered by the previous reviewers. As a long time PS2 and PSE3 user, I have used these programs to generate stunning art work, which usually begins with my own photos and then utilization of a variety of brushes, plug-ins, styles. I have a hunch there are others 'out there' who have intuitively discovered the grand set of tools available in PS and PSE, who may appreciate the following discoveries (much to my dismay and disappointment) before making any kind of upgrade to this version. The bottom line (and this is after several correspondences with Adobe tech support) is that many of my precious plug-in's (Kai Power Tools and Xaos Terrazzo) DO NOT work with this version!! Also, although brush,shape and gradient files can be added (dropped into the appropriate folders), the styles files CANNOT be added!! Anyone who has worked extensively with styles will know how valuable they are! There is an assortment of 'canned styles' included, but if you go to the preset manager there is no longer even a drop down to select 'styles' as in other versions of PS and PSE!! If any of this is of significance to a reviewer, and helps to avoid making a hasty purchase, then I will feel a little better about my own hasty rush to upgrade. Will I use PSE8? Of course, but I will stay primarily though, with the earlier versions that allow free addition of styles and work with my precious plug-ins! I'm so disappointed, but am learning the hard lesson that newest and latest, isn't always the best choice!!"
5,Mobile me makes life much easier for both personal and profesional uses. I could not get along without it.
1,AFTER 4 TRIES AND EXCUSES FROM QUICKEN AND NEARLY DESTROYING MY RECORDS I AWAIT THE LATEST PROMISE IT WILL WORK OR A GUARANTEE OF A DOWNLOAD FROM THEM THAT IS FOOL PROOF THIS IS A RIDICULES EXCUSE OF A PRODUCT RELEASE
2,"I have used Turbo Tax since the early 2000' s (with one exception in 2006, when I used TaxCut) and have been somewhat satisfied. I just finished my taxes for 2013 (yes, it's late, but I have an extension to October 15) and find that for some reason, I have had significantly more issues with the 2013 version. Because of this, I need to mail in my return because TTax will not electronically file a return to the IRS if the taxpayer has overridden one of its entries. The foreign tax credit (FTC) component has a huge problem. A taxpayer is allow to claim the entire credit on Line 47 of Form 1040 if it is no more than $300 (single) or $600 (married). The taxpayer can claim the entire amount with no reduction. However, I have not been able to do this on TTax without performing an override because TTax generates a Form 1116 which performs some calculations which result in a reduction of the credit. It is true that Form 1116 does not have to be filed in this case; the problem is that the calculations are affecting the line item on the 1040. The result is that I cannot file this return online. Another shortcoming on TTax Premier is that there is insufficient direction for properly filling out limited partnership information that a taxpayer might receive for, say, holding shares in a MLP (a real possibility if the taxpayer is an income investor). The MLP's Form 1065 has a plethora of information in the \\""Statement\\"" section, but much of it cannot be entered into TTax. One final problem: TTax does not download a number of brokerage 1099's. It does this for the more popular brokers (such as Schwab, which downloaded with no problems), but does not do so for Interactive Brokers or Options House. That meant all th e sales have to be hand-entered. These brokerages do not provide sales information in a friendly format, so it can be a bear to have to enter this information manually."
4,A good variety of games. Placement of the players' faces obscures my ability to read some of the cards well. I did not have this problem with a much earlier edition.
1,I didn't notice that this was for an old operating system when I bought it. I would not even load. Very disappointed.
5,"I'm not sure my four year old computer has all the highest system requirements, but the software works great and has a really nice interface. I was initially impressed with the quality of the appearance (nice layout and color choices, like Adobe's pretty logo) and straighforward option titles, but the real beauty is in the output. I installed the software, a ten minute process, and within two hours had an amazing slideshow, using most of the automated options, to use for my daughter's grad party. The user's guide is great. I read all the instructions for making a slideshow while it was installing. It was easy to figure out the steps because every time your mouse hovers over an option, it tells you what that option does. Love that. I was able to import video from my Panasonic HDC-TM55 and my Flip HD camera with no issues. The magic movie option is really, really fun if you don't need to be hands-on and picky about each scene's length or the transitions. I love the idea of 'rooms,' such as the media room, effect room, title room, etc. You know where to go for just what you want to do. The Title room is my favorite because I've been so frustrated with that aspect in other software, like Adobe's Premiere Elements. Making titles in Microsoft's old version of Movie Maker was quite easy, but also quite limited. This is just as easy as Movie Maker, but it's pretty much unlimited in my opinion. You can make titles as easy or complex as you like. I will never use all the options available, but will enjoy the ones I do use. I would suggset this software is best for people who are familiar with video editing software. Beginners should try to download an old version of Movie Maker and stick with that for a while."
1,I purchased Windows XP Home with service pack 3. The disk I received was Windows XP Professional Corporate Edition. So I am afraid to try to use it because of possible legal action by the corporation that this disk belongs too.
1,"I have used Norton products for the PC and Mac for over 20 years. Based on my latest experience, I will NEVER purchase another Norton product. I installed NIS 2013 shortly after upgrading to Windows 8. NIS 2013 simply doesn't work with Windows 8. I started having problems downloading emails, then problems installing program/app updates. I suspected NIS might be a problem, so I disabled the software. Then I couldn't re-establish NIS. I then uninstalled and reinstalled the NIS, same problems as before. While on the phone with Norton tech support, my computer crashes and I can't recover. They tell me to call Microsoft tech support. Windows recovery disk also doesn't work. MS also can't help, short of telling me to wipe my computer clean, then reinstall Windows 8. Finally, I was able to uninstall NIS while in Safe Mode. By the way, Windows 8 comes with Anti-Virus (which both Norton and MS failed to mention to me). I made sure that Windows 8 anti-virus was enabled and I haven't had a problem since.<br /><br />Norton - you just lost a customer of 20+ years"
4,"Ps is a great product and cs6 really does right by the user. The only reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5, is because of the difficulty of use. Ps has a true learning curve and it isn't user friendly."
5,I have not found any other software this complete and easy to use. It teaches at my pace. I can review or repeat as much as I need for comprehension. The best on the market! You won't be disappointed.
3,"Because one \\""employer\\"" who should be paying me as a subcontractor (I really am self employed) deducts taxes in whatever state you work in (almost all of my work is out of state, and my other W-2 clients deduct my residential state tax or none at all) I have to file more than one state return. This was my first year with Turbo Tax since 2006 tax year. The first state return is included in the Home & Business software and is free. When I went to do the second state return, TurboTax wanted to charge me $39.95. I thought that a bit much and went poking around their website (not designed to get you human interaction very swiftly). The TurboTax \\""chat\\"" person told me second state return is $19.95 had I bought the CD version. I explained I downloaded the software from amazon.com (after all it is 2012, and aren't CD's becoming obsolete for software?). He had me uninstall TurboTax, and download a new copy, promising I would be charged $19.95 for 2nd state return. I opened the new download, and it was still $39.95. Ultimately, he gave me the 2nd state return for free. I would have been happy with $19.95 and it did take 45 minutes to get to our conclusion, but free is free. Note that when filling out the state return, the interview asked if I had \\""high deductible\\"" health plan. I said yes, knowing that those premiums were already deducted from federal AGI as Self Employed Health Insurance Deduction (SEHID). TurboTax leads me to deduct the health insurance premiums a second time, from AGI, even though the state return gets its info from the TurboTax fed return. I'm waiting for TurboTax tax rep to get back to me on that. I'm sure its an error in TurboTax, and have seen similar double deduction last year in H&R Block software - ironic that it was health insurance premium as well. I have to buy the expensive Home & Business version because I file a Schedule C. Yet it still seems the software is designed for someone in a less complex situation, one employer, period."
3,Does the job for what I bought it for.
5,"I have used Quickbooks since 1996. Before this version I was using Pro 08 and got caught in the forced upgrade. I am a creature of habit and hate change. BUT can you imagine using the QB from 1996 in 2011? Even though I gripe, whine and complain I know that in the end the upgrade, for the most part, is for the better. I purchased Pro 11 off amazon last week when it was only $99, happy about that. I completed my work for the week and started Fri morning with my install. Some of the reviews on here really scared the heck out of me so I was prepared for a long, tear filled stressful day. I am happy to report that my install could not have been better. Took about 30 minutes and I was up and running. I even got a signature scanned for paychecks & I am working on the logo to get it just right. Everything is exactly how it was and I have no complaints with this new product. This comment is for the QB people on here - one thing that changed from the 2006 to the 2008 version and is the same in 2011 that I am not happy with is in Customers & Jobs. We are in construction. I will have a developer that we do several jobs for, those jobs will have several phases, so it will be at lease 3 teired. In 2006 I could add Developer, right click and add job (job name & info) then right click on that and add phase (job # with phase #). I used to be able to have each phase with a different \\""ship to\\"" without having to add a million different ship to addresses. You guys should look at how that was in 2006 and make it like that again. That is probably the only thing I would change in QB."
4,"I moved to Mandrake from RedHat because Mandrake supported a device I had that RedHat did not. This is a nice distro for users new to Linux because it's fairly friendly to install and is one of the best at having built in support for newer hardware. Mandrake also has two community tech support lists that are very active, and their programmers participate regularly. The PowerPack has some nice extras to play with, like ViaVoice and Arkeia network backup software. It seems to install well on a variety of machines. I'm very pleased with its ease of installation and its performance."
3,"Nero 9.0 was an absolute disaster, a disaster made even worse by comments from Nero on their own forum that suggested they were well aware that Nero 9.0 was exceptionally flawed and that there were no quick fixes available.<br /><br />They said to wait for an update... and in June 2009, an update finally arrived (version 9.4), and it has in my opinion made Nero well again.<br /><br />However, it was unconscionable that they left everyone with only semi-working software for several months. During those months, people even started writing their own code fixes to restore functionality that had been broken. I imagine many people no longer trust the company after this fiasco.<br /><br />But for the record, everything seems ok again. And it is a free upgrade from 9.0 to 9.4, of course."
5,I am very satisfied with the product. It was easy to install and the price was right- about $50.00 less than purchasing it directly from microsoft. It was more economical than buying a new computer system.
4,Now these are small objects and my old eyes are having a hard time finding all of them now but I keep trying until I find them. There are some surprise and challenges as you play. It isn't one you can get done in a hurry.

I highly recommend waiting until Microsoft deals with the initial release bugs. Stick with 2010 for a while longer. This one was pushed out the door way too early.

The help file tells you to go to the setup on the Art Studio screen to setup borderless printing...only one problem..there IS NO SETUP option on that screen. No \\""borderless\\"" settings work even though I DO have a new HP Photosmart Plus printer that of course CAN do borderless. If I were you I would not invest 3 cents for this program much less the full retail price."
5,"When I saw Quicken WillMaker 2013 I didn't know everything that was involved with estate planning. That's where the plus comes in. With WillMaker I was able to create many documents that will help before I move on from this life. These include my living will, heath-care directive, and limited power of attorney.<br /><br />I have to admit that it took a while for me to get around to creating a will and doing estate planning. I guess it just made that reality of life a little too real to me. When I did WillMaker plus made the process easier than I expected. It was effectively painless.<br /><br />I didn't use the support - but other reviews provide glowing reviews which I suspect are founded based on the well thought-out software.<br /><br />This is a good DIY tool for straightforward estate planning: probably 90+ percent of estates. It probably gets a good start on much more complicated planning that will requires a visit to legal office. The head start that WillMaker Plus could provide in paperwork and organization may save hundreds or thousands in legal fees compared to going in with nothing."
1,"This product appears to have real value in it. The parts of the software that I can get to work have the potential to be great tools for improving your singing. Unfortunately, the meat of the product, the singing lessons, will not run on my computer and I have been unsuccessful at getting technical support for the product. Over the past week, I have sent emails and called durring business hours. No one was present to answer my calls and never returned the emails of voice messsages I left. At this point I intend to return the software."
5,Easy to use with no formal training needed. Even CPA approves of it! I would highly recommend this product for any small business starting out.
1,This version of TurbiTax would not install. Have spent very much money to have PC worked on and subscribed to a company to scan my PC and correct any errors. The Turbotax still would not install. Finally had to download a free versionf rom Intuit in order to get it installed. Intuit really dropped the ball on this version. I have used TurvoTax since 1989 and have never been disappointed in it until now
4,"This is a welcome upgrade from the previous version. Trend Micro anti-virus already tends to use less resources than some of the other options but this upgrade gets even better. The only time you even notice that it is installed is when it is upgrading or you have told it to scan your system and that is only because of the window on your screen. It does not slow down your system at any noticeable rate. Also, it scans your system much faster than previous versions of this software."
4,Works great....as long as you have some degree of technical know how.The 'average joe' may have trouble.
5,I have used McAfee Total Protection for the last 7 years. No problems. Great product.
5,This was an excellent price for an outstanding product. It was easy to install and easy to use. What more can I ask for.
3,"Here's the thing, the Quick Books program is great. It makes paying bills, printing invoices, creating estimates and many more things, super easy! The QB software works until you choose to update to a newer version. So, if you'd like to run QB 2010 for 2 years or 5 years, you can. Here's the catch, the Payroll that you buy in the package is only good for 1 year. Yes, 1 year only! Every year after that you either have to buy the payroll software again (and pay more for it than you'd pay to get a whole new complete edition of QB) or just bite the bullet and pay for the new edition of QB+Payroll. Ridiculous? Yes. Worth it? Debatable."
5,"I have been using TurboTax for many years. I see the changes that TerboTax, using suggestions from Beta Testing team members, have put into place. I am proud to say that you will not find a better team of people or TurboTax product to work with. TurboTax works real good for me each year. I will not use another system to do my tax returns."
5,Good
2,"Tough learning curve. Still practicing. I am pretty good with computers, but you almost have to be a computer architech to use this software efficiently."

4,"I have tried Sonic, Nero and Roxio products in the past with limited success since I need closed captioning to work (hard of hearing/deaf). I use a set-top DVD recorder with DVD-RAM and edit on my PC. Every program before has deleted the closed captioning and usually won't work with DVD-RAM so I had to first convert the DVD-RAM using Panasonic software. <br /> <br />Videostudio not only imports the DVD-RAM file directly, it also keeps the captioning intact. I find it very intuitive to use but I am more \\""computer literate\\"" than average. I didn't need the manual at all. <br /> <br />Nero might be quicker to burn copies but it was miserable to create the DVD compared to this. Sonic MyDVD worked directly with the Panasonic software but if I edited the file at all it took forever and often failed. Videostudio seems to work as one package so I don't need MyDVD and Panasonic software anymore. It's a good thing because Panasonic doesn't support Vista and I just upgraded so I NEED something that works. This does."
1,Cannot get it to work. It starts to boot and then goes into a locked up status. The directions that came with it do not help either.
5,"I like McAfee software, I have used it for several years and I trust that it does what it is supposed to do. No problems at all."
1,The CDDB database flat out does not work at all which renders the program essentially useless. And you can forget MAGIX support or the user forum. AVOID THIS PRODUCT!!
5,"This program Kaspersky Internet Security has been very helpful to protect my computer, I trust Kaspersky truth. It is easy to install and has never given me any problems, I recommend it 100%."
1,"Don't buy it. My kids will probably all gratuate from college before I can get a DVD project completed with this software. It is a lemon. It has awesome features, which makes the experience all the more bitter. You think you've created a masterpiece, and then some software bug corrupts your project and makes a DVD unproducable. It'll fail you when you most need it.<br />If Pinnacle ever gets their act together, I'll revise this review. But for now, I'd give it negative stars if I could."
3,"McAfee doesn't prevent bad viruses from taking over your computer, I have always used McAfee & periodically have to either buy a new computer or take mine to the shop to have the \\""brain\\"" fixed or replaced due to viruses. I highly reccomend the seller I used for this purchase which is Belisarius Trading because they had the best price (about what the software is actually worth...which is not much at at all) & they shipped it very promptly.<br /><br />Bit Defender is the best antivirus software I personally have ever used."
5,Great service in all the packing and I really like it a whole lot because I just really did like it
1,"Device haphazardly detects HDMI input, sometimes not recognizing a signal at all until the unit is powered on/off several times.<br /><br />Software randomly locks up even when not capturing.<br /><br />Will display HDCP content but won't let you record it? Bizzare.<br /><br />The fact that it respects HDCP is commendable if you're a fan of DRM, but ultimately useless for the average consumer since it prevents you from copying a rather large portion of media that you legitimately own the right to enjoy. The offered alternative being to \\""just record in low def\\"" isn't acceptable.<br /><br />New versions of this device also seem to block using other capture software (ie: VirtualDub) which is frustrating considering the provided software is so unreliable."
5,Thank you. ..
1,I've been using Quicken on PCs for many years. Went over to Mac and Essentials two days ago. Data imported OK but Essentials is maddeningly opaque and hard to use. Unable to enter a simple split deposit I tried help: Good luck with that. Help is no help at all.

5,Received the Trubo Tax Deluxe on the date promised. Product easily installed and is being used right now.
4,"I liked this software a lot better than LR 3, but then upgraded my computer so I can now use LR 5 and Photoshop CC. The upgrade to LR 5 is worth it, if your computer can handle it. If not, this is a really great value also. It just doesn't have some of the conveniences of LR 5."
3,"ACD Systems FotoSlate 4 has the potential to be a really great piece of software. Unfortunately it falls short for my use. Perhaps if you want a single document with different layouts for each page and are going to do a lot of adjustments by hand then this will be just the thing for you. What I was hoping for was the ability to take a large number of images and put them on multiple pages, either 6 or 12 per page, with the images scaled and rotated properly and with the file name as the caption. It looks like the software is supposed to do that but it doesn't. There is an option to \\""auto-rotate images\\"" but it either rotates all images (even those that didn't need to be rotated) or it doesn't rotate any. So, all images are printed in either vertical or horizontal orientation, rather than the appropriate orientation for the individual images. It is possible to manually rotate those images that are wrong but it's impossible to select multiple images so you have to do it one image at a time. That's quite time consuming when you have hundreds or thousands of images to rotate. Although the ACD Systems web site has user forums and there is a link to submit technical questions, they seem to be either broken or simply abandoned and not actually in use. There are recent posts in the forums for other products but not for Fotoslate. Once registered you'd think I could post to the forum but that feature seems to be broken. It's too bad, really. I wanted to like this package and it is quite close to being just what I need. But for me, it's mostly useless."

4,"My son volunteered to overhaul my laptop, which I had purchased early in 2007 so that it would have the \\""new and great\\"" Vista operating system on it. Well, as probably everyone knows by now, Vista was a colossal joke of an operating system. After enduring several years of slow boot-ups, computer freeze-ups and countless other problems, I followed my son's recommendation to wipe my hard drive clean and install Windows 7 Professional. He handled the work for me and my laptop's operation is so much improved that it's hard to imagine it's the same machine. In short, I'm very happy with the Windows 7 Professional product from Amazon. But has anyone thought of filing a class-action lawsuit against Microsoft for putting out a product as flawed as Vista? Windows 7 Professional is so much better that it makes me wonder why Microsoft ever put its name on something as bad as Vista."
1,"I use (TurboTax, Mint) or have used (QuickBooks Pro) other Intuit products successfully, but Quicken Deluxe 2014 is awful! I'm going to try to return it to amazon. It will not download my retirement account data. I've even tried uninstalling the program and reinstalling it. Nothing helps. It downloaded my bank checking and savings accounts just fine, but for my retirement accounts at one brokerage firm, it downloads the account numbers but shows a zero balance in each of them. At another brokerage firm, it downloaded one of my three accounts (and that one incorrectly--it showed the balance in securities and also in cash, showing double the correct balance), but won't download anything, even the account #'s, of the other two accounts at this firm. It's like those two don't exist. When I log into both these brokerage houses outside of Quicken, my info shows correctly for all six accounts. I've tried to download these into Quicken multiple times, trying \\""brokerage\\"", \\""IRA\\"", \\""advanced\\"", etc. These are major brokerage firms, and I'm using Windows 7. I am ready to throw Quicken out the window!<br /><br />In fairness, it did download one mutual fund account correctly, but one out of seven isn't good enough.<br /><br />I have used Mint, and it downloads all of these accounts correctly, with no problem. It updated their balances today, correctly, and shows their transactions. I'm puzzled as to why Intuit's free program can do this, but their paid Deluxe program cannot.<br /><br />I am also disappointed and surprised to learn that it will not transfer my Mint data into Quicken. I had planned to delete my Mint account and start using Quicken, but Quicken just doesn't work for my retirement accounts. My reason for wanting to change is that I'm just not comfortable having all my log-in information stored on Mint's servers.<br /><br />Edit: I've just printed the return label. I'm pleased that amazon allows returns of software."
2,"This game unfortunatly might be unstable for some windows XP. I bought this game years ago for my first child when we had windows 95 and it was wonderful!! She loved it and it was a great teaching tool. But when we upgrated to XP, everytime when I tryed to play it, it would just shut my computer down. I was excited when I ordered this one because I thought that it had been updated for XP but apparently it was not because when I recieved it, it does the same thing. It might work on some XP's, I'm not sure but I know it does not work on mine. I hate it, because I so wanted to use it for my other daughter who is 3 years old."
5,I do love my games. This one is a good one and would recommend for your pesonal use or as gift.<br />It keeps me thinking.
5,"I stepped over GoLive a few years back, don't remember which version, but didn't get into it then.<BR>I decided to get into it now during version 5 however, with the free upgrade to version 6, since I couldn't be bothered waiting for it to reach the market!<BR>However the user-friendlyness has been improved a lot with GL6 and it is now not only a lot stronger and yes, slower, but also a bit easier to get around.<BR><BR>Oh, dear I forgot to mention the diagrams when I submitted this review the first time!! They have appered to me as the best thing yet with GL - just because I find them very useful. When you first start a site up (you can do it later too of course), you have the ability to create a site diagram, OK that might not be that revolutionary.. What is so great about them is that you can create them with different symbols from the objects palette; database, PDF, page etc and once you've set them up GL actually creates a site with all the pages you've specified in the diagram. Further more you can show the diagram as a PDF or SVG file to your client online! Of course you can use the diagram as a reference throughout the design process.<br />I was recommended GL years ago by fellow webdesigners in London who told me that it would be good for me since I don't know html and that way I would learn it. My London co-workers couldn't have been more right - I have learnt a lot since I've gotten GL and I am still learning. Now with version 6 I also find that I am learning ASP, JSP etc as well and I mean I learn it practically, there is only so much you can read yourself to!!<br />Web Workgroup Server 1.0 that comes with this version is also something that I've started to enjoy, especially with consideration to that it now makes it a whole lot easier for me and my collegues worldwide to check pages etc in and out of a website, without me having to do, way too much supervising either - it saves time for me and that is valuable!!<BR>It's got a weblog with it, but I stillhaven't been able to figure out whether or not that shows who has been trying to log into the server and who had problems, or who got in straight away.<BR>The other bad thing is that I was reading the instructions for how to set it up and while I was doing that, I missed the few seconds I had to change the \\""system\\"" and \\""password\\"" -> I found myself locked out of the server and the only way I saw, was that I had to re-install the whole thing and fill in the password before time-out. That was annoying, but of course it is very likely that I missed something, since I had to do that, considering the server is a whole new program and part of GL..<BR> After I got in, it was however fairly straight forward to configure the website, publishing server and users.<BR>I find that Adobe is best for me since there are so many resources over at Adobe Studio for one, you can find free actions and new templates and just get so many great ideas from other users on how to do things quickly. It's great because there is so many ppl around who you can ask for help if you need it."
1,"Like the other reviewer from DeSoto, Texas said below, I too am experiencing crashes on a very robust installation of Windows XP. I am a hardware/software technician with over 10 years of field experience and I have a degree in Recording Engineering, yet, I cannot get this product to run on my system. I also have their DM2 mixer and used previous versions of their software on Win98 with no problems. I am hesitant to try their newer StudioXPro product fearing that it too will crash upon launch.<br />They really do have extremely poor support. They did NOT respond to any of my SEVEN e-mails regarding this problem. The only way to contact them is via e-mail. I even considered knocking on their doors when I last visited San Francisco, but their website only shows a PO BOX!<br />Until they get their act together, avoid MixMan. It's too bad too because they have a promising product line. They just don't know how to run a software company."
2,"I have Mac OSX Lion and have used Toast for years with my macs. I talked myself into buying the Toast 11 Pro (I had Toast 10) because I really needed to convert my old family Super 8's that I had transferred years ago into my external drive digitally.<br />I had several (5) DVD-R's that would only convert 1/2 of the DVD-R digitally to ANY file format. I tried several times with several conversion formats with the same result: 1/2 of the DVD-R. The pre-process conversion would read that the entire DVD-R would transfer; but only 1/2 would actually convert. Iy did not matter if the DVD=R was 2 hours long or 45 minutes...only 1/2 was converted.<br /><br />I finally had some DVD-Rs from the late 1990's of family that had audio as well as video as they were recorded originally on Hi -8 and put onto DVD-R.<br />These converted video OK to .mov files, but there were 2 second audio sync problems on the finished conversions. I tried several times with different formats--SAME PROBLEM. Unacceptable!<br />I purchased another program and I have had no problems with all of the situations listed above.<br /><br />As far as CD audio burning...the Toast 11 program is great...but any older Toast can do that! No need to upgrade.<br /><br />If you are going to burn CD's and/or Data files to CD or DVD/Bluray--I am sure that Toast 11 Pro will work fine for you. For Conversions: Toast 11 falls flat and short of expectations. School Grade: D+ and a lot of extra \\""Re-do\\"" work for me."
5,"I am pleased in all respects with this program. I have a Pentium 4,windows XP computer and only had very minor problems with installation. I took my time studying what each function did and compared it PC Tools Registry Mechanic which is basically the same thing and activated only those utilities which matched it and the little meter quickly went all the way to the right. So far I have not experienced any of the problems listed by other users in terms of loss of passwords or loss of anything period! Clearly when one buys new software,it behooves the person to study it closely to see if it is really going to fit the bill for your computer maintenance needs and so I give this program kudo's for doing exactly what it indicates!"
3,"Greetings all.<br /><br />I purchased 'Fate: Jewel Case edition' believing I was purchasing Fate, Fate 2 (Undiscovered Reality) and Fate 3 (The Traitor Soul). It arrived on time and in good condition.<br /><br />I'm running the game on Windows 7. When I attempted to load and install the game my computer had a difficult time reading the disk. I eventually needed to resort to opening the game manually through Windows Explorer. Although the load was very slow, the game loaded successfully.<br /><br />At first look after installation it appeared I only had access to Fate 3 (The Traitor Soul). I became a touch irritated. Through the search process of looking for the first two Fate games I loaded a game storage site called \\""Wild Tangent,\\"" a site where an individual can pay and play older games. Fate was there as was Fate 2 (Undiscovered Reality) however, there was a charge to play either of the games, which between the two would have cost more than double what I paid for the Jewel Case edition of Fate. Now I am more than irritated. I figure its time to send a very nasty note to the folks I purchased the game from and I headed back to Amazon to let them know my feelings in very clear and concise words. Luckily for me, I didn't get that far.<br /><br />I choose to read through the reviews before giving in to my injured sense of fairness in the market place. First I read all the reviews of those who rated the game a 1. With a couple of exceptions in which the reviewer just wanted to hear him/herself rant, the reviewers experienced the same issue I did. I was feeling proud of myself now knowing I wasn't alone. However, there was a slight dent in my personal feelings of belonging to a disgruntled crowd. . . There were a whole lot more folks who rated the game 5 stars. Why that was, I decided I needed to find out.<br /><br />The first Five Star rating I read was written by Oddlydrawn. He explained how Fate 3 (The Traitor Soul) contains within itself the other two games, as Fate 2 and 3 were expansions to the original Fate.<br /><br />So good reader--if you have not read Oddlydrawn's review I believe you will find it very helpful and then, perhaps, like me, you will begin to feel the world isn't as bad as it was half an hour ago. :-)<br /><br />~Somewhere in the process of getting older, I forgot to grow up.~o games, as Fate 2 and 3 were expansions to the original Fate.<br /><br />So good reader--if you have not read Oddlydrawn's review I believe you will find it very helpful and then, perhaps, like me, you will begin to feel the world isn't as bad as it was half an hour ago. :-)<br /><br />~Somewhere in the process of getting older, I forgot to grow up.~"
4,"I beta tested Vista from early on and have run the complete version for about 2 months now via TechNet and Microsoft Connect. I love how it works and runs. Only real argument I have is that I run it 64 bit with a dual core and some programs are not compatable (not Microsoft's fault.) They need to catch up! On another note, Microsoft released details of this OS a long time ago, yet kept dropping features (new file system...) to get to an earlier release date. Again, I love it, but after 5 years of the \\""best\\"" programers, I expected more."
5,"I've used this program (mainly for short story writing) for years. I love the latest version (4), particularly the storyboard feature, which makes it easy to visualize and reorganize scenes and chapters. The writing targets feature is great for keeping you motivated, and I also use the name generator a lot, to come up with authentic-sounding characters. These are just three of the many tools in WriteItNow, but it is the flexibility of the software that makes it a winner for me."
1,"Before you buy this software read all of Amazon's reviews, and the user forums @ Roxio. This software is riddled with bugs, causes serious system crashes, and incredible frustration. Read Roxio's workaround for the problems before you install this, because if it crashes your computer, you're going to be spending a day or two manually cleaning your registry. <br /> <br />The problems mostly seem to happen when upgrading from previous versions. I have used, and loved, Roxio since version 5, and have upgraded to every version since then with little or no difficulty. But when I upgraded from 8 to 9 all hell broke loose. Major crashes, not just of the OS, but other software. Incredibly hard time uninstalling Roxio 9. Thought I would have to do a clean install of Windows to get my system back, but after several attempts at deleting all Roxio references in the registry, and then doing a \\""system restore,\\"" I got the OS stabile again. But this took about twelve hours to accomplish, and because of the system restore rollback, I had to redo a lot of work. <br /> <br />Save yourself some some aggrevation: READ BEFOR YOU BUY! If one or two Amazon reviews were negative you could chalk it up to \\""user error.\\"" But there is a pattern of serious crashes with this software. You have been warned!"
5,The software is just what I expected. The quality of the cd was excellent condition. If your looking at revising PDF file you need it.
5,Lots of wonderful pictures to put together.
1,"I am so disappointed with this product. I previously had Hallmark Christian Studio 2 Deluxe and it was very 'user friendly'. There were many styles to choose from and you were able to be very creative. I spent hours going through these cards and there no 'pretty' cards. The majority of them were like cartoon drawings - not something I would send to an older adult. The messages inside were 'fluff' and though I knew it was not a Christian Card program, I did expect there would perhaps be some religious selection in the Christmas section. I was wrong. It was actually work in choosing a card and some of them, even in the Preview mode, were unreadable. You had to click all over the place to open, see inside, and close each card. All in all, with a choice of thousands of cards, I didn't find enough to even bother with keeping the product. (I misplaced my disc for my other program.)I spent weeks in deciding which program to get and went with the Hallmark name and my experience with the previous product I had been so happy with. It's being returned and I'm still looking for a replacement."
5,"I use TurboTax every year, only had one problem which caused me a late penalty with IRS. If you take out money from your 401k, it you are not not allowed to get the 401k deduction for that year, even if you resume paying into your plan after the 6 month period where you cannot resume paying into your plan. Also, the price went down $10 the next week."
5,This is the only software that has ever kept my computers running smoothly without interfering with my use of the computer. I am really happy with how comprehensive the package is and how well it performs on all fronts.
4,Good for updating old Will
4,useful gadget for audio books & photos with SDcard<br /><br />can watch videos on it too if they are in the right format<br /><br />Can be an e-reader for text but not the greatest to use that way<br /><br />I bought it for $20 not for the recipes although they are pretty good.. but to see if I wanted .. a kindle or other type of e-reader.<br /><br />I read many books...and wondered if I would want to give up turning 'paper pages'. My conclusion? dont think other expensive electronic page turners..are for me.<br /><br />While the quality of the screen on this<br />MiBook is good..and sound is not so bad either...that is not the issue..it is for me...missing the smell and feel of paper.<br /><br />But I'm an old coot...maybe younger would think differently.<br /><br />For the cook...it could be a fun platform to ..make your own recipes to customize and give as a gift to special people in your life.<br /><br />This gadget...could be put to many uses other than what it is marketed as.. not to say..what it is may not be enough but it can be..much much more with a little tech savvy.<br /><br />All in all I find this to be a good value and enjoyable to play with...I also listen to music on it..can play all my mp3 files with ease...so it does fill several niches<br /><br />again...a well spent $20 saved me hundreds ..in that I won't buy other much more expensive gadgets... that I would not use.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon seller for letting me buy/try a $130 gadget for $20 and ultimately I will...give it away ultimately...as a gift .. possibly with an SD card with home movies on it or me singing lullabyes...or loaded with family photos and clips of old family home movies. So many uses I can think of to keep it and similar..out of our landfills.
1,"I absolutely hate this software! Have used Elements for years, recently upgrading from PSE 11 because of a new camera ( 11 doesn't support the RAW for the camera). It locks up my computer constantly! I have all the specs needed to run this program. It is going in the trash and I will convert my photos to dng. files so I can go back to 11."
5,GREAT
1,"WinDVD 5 Gold is a great disappointment. It is a cumbersome program, compared to InterVideo WinDVD 2.1 that I have enjoyed for years. The only reason I decided to buy WinDVD 5 Gold is that I purchased a new computer, and wanted to install a good DVD player. After using this new version, I went online to find a used 2.1 -- and fortunately I was successful. The only redeeming quality WinDVD 5 Gold has is its provision for video production. But for DVD viewing, I'll take the old version anytime!!"
2,i used this program for a few weeks.. works ok .. but i then got the google tool bar for free i like its pop up stopper better.. check it out its free...
5,"Have used Quicken for a lotta years. Am very happy with it. Have upgraded periodically and the upgrades are easy and uneventful. Don't use all of the functions, but use what I need."
5,"This is the best media players you can buy today. The best picture, Blu-ray discs, 3D, and every thing else out there you can play is supported (as far as I know).<br /><br />The picture is tremendous on our Sharp LC-42LE540U 42\\"" LED TV V with wi-fi.<br /><br />- only thing missing for me would be subtitle search function<br /><br />Of the 3 versions I have only used the Ultra.<br /><br />Standard does not support 3D or Blu-ray.<br /><br />Pro supports Blu-ray but not 3D.<br /><br />The Ultra supports them both plus 20GB of online storage, but only for one year."
4,This program is entertaining and easy to use. The interface is quite intuitive. The lessons flow naturally and are actually pretty fun and sort of addicting. A good indonesian-english dictionary would serve as a useful compliment to this product. It's only weakness is that it contains little on conversation. A listing of common phrases and their usages would be handy. You might also consider purchasing a good phrasebook.
3,"This is a good software for the kids, but was not developed to sustain their excitement. After the first few days, my kids became bored with it especially after they solved the entire puzzle. My suggestion is that software such as these, should be written in a format to enable the kids start afresh at the end of the puzzle."
5,Excellent tool for website design. Now I need a complete workshop to learn all the tools it has.
2,This is a good program and method overall but the price is just too high in my opinion. I would recomend taking a look at Spanish Now by Transparent Language which is also has a good method and a very good program but much more affordable.
2,"We shouldn't have to be engineers to get a program working. All I wanted is a greeting card program, so the other 99% is just a waste of the software. I should mention, I ordered v8 but was sent v9. Perhaps the v8 would have been a better program."
4,"Having purchased Vista, but wishing to keep Windows XP MCE, I purchased Acronis Disk Director Suite 10 in order to set up a dual boot system that would accommodate both operating systems. In addition to the Acronis product I also had a copy of Norton Partition Magic, and since I had two identical desktop PCs to configure in a dual-boot mode I intended to use Acronis on one and Norton on the other. After a few hours of Symantec software torture I abandoned the Norton product, and easily configured both PCs using the Acronis Disk Director. I have yet to figure out why Norton Partition Magic would not step through the dual boot configuration process, but Acronis Disk Director 10 sailed right through without a hitch. I have been using Norton products for years, and while Symantec makes quality software they also engineer their product line with a sufficient number of traps to drive even the most patient geek certifiably mad. You may ask why Disk Director did not get the 5-star rating; the answer is that Acronis has a few unnecessary traps of its own (but not quite enough to coax you into using the software as a frisbee) So, if I ever have the occasion to again set up a PC to accommodate two operating systems (dual-boot), and the software choices are between Acronis and Norton, I will not hesitate to purchase Disk Director; I highly recommend this software."
1,"I have never downolad the Office 2007 but for some strange reason it appeared on my PC after I openned up a file from my colleague a few months ago or might be due to my regular Microsoft updates. Every time I open up my file, my PC will automatically open it in Office 2007 and requests me to purchase it otherwise I can not modify my file. Office 2007 seems like stealthly get into my PC without my permission. I am very happy with Office 2003 and really want to get rid of the Office 2007 from my PC."
2,"I'm sorry I didn't listen when I was advised to wait until I purchased a new PC. For Windows Vista, your system may lack resources. Though it will run, it runs much slower. At least with Windows XP, I could play my movies on DVD. My video card was not up to snuff for Windows Vista. I had driver problems but finally got the right ones. I found I was happier with Windows XP, so I went back to it."
5,"This is the best yearly upgrade in a few years. Faster, smarter, better integration with TurboTax. With as many version and data entry possibilities, there may a few users with upgrade issues. Quicken tech support has greatly improved. So, if you were waiting, stop and get this version."
5,"This app is incredible. I originally bought it for the \\""FormTyper\\"" feature that lets you make unfillable PDF forms instantly fillable, but later found out it would let me edit text and graphics in PDF files. I previously avoided PDF files because they couldn't be used for anything really with Acrobat Reader, and Acrobat Standard was too darn expensive. This program is Adobe's worst nightmare - now people have a real alternative to their bloated, slow, over priced Acrobat solution. Isn't competition wonderful?"
2,Purchased this in early November 2009. Version 2010 R2. Found that it was incompatible with Union Bank checking (older versions work fine). As of now you will not be able to download UB transactions to Quicken. Union Bank claimed it would work manually if you downloaded and then opened the download file in Quicken but the UB support person and I spent a lot of time trying but that did not work. Union Bank claims there are other issues as well. So my advise is don't buy 2010 until well into 2010 after Intuit has fixed these problems.
4,"Kaplan normally does a very good job with review materials. This one seems like it was hastily made and not updated very recently. It's still a good product, deserving of a good rating. It certainly addresses the right subject material, but I would like to see a name like Kaplan provide a more dynamic user experience."
5,"The price is so low, there is no reason not to upgrade! It gets your computer ready for the \\""next great thing\\"" from Apple, and does so seamlessly and (almost) effortlessly. The refinements (not really new features, but close to it, such as, how the Dock and stacks now work) make life on the computer easier and more pleasant. [...]."
5,"I don't know why so many people hated it, I'm coming from a 10 year old machine that was using windows vista and since I first saw Win 8.1 I knew it would be great for my first build! I love it! The learning process it is really fun. Don't hesitate to buy it by the reviews!"
5,just what I needed.
5,"I just recently upgraded to vista, and was looking for a dvd copy software compatible with it; this works great, no conflicts; would recommend for anyone using vista"
3,learning curve is just too much. Not as easy to use as expected.
2,Hard to tell from MS descriptions of their products if encryption options are available. After rec'g the item and loading it the product does not support encryption so I had to return and upgrade.
2,"It's okay and the interface is nice, but with the images on the box one would think they were getting elegant images for scrapbook pages, NOT, I hate cutsey and most of it is just that! Not what I want and since there is a 90 day money back guarantee, guess what? It's going back and the company better give me my $40.00 back! not an exchange either. <br /> <br />"
5,"I was extremely pleased with this training video. The video player was very full featured; far better than any I have used in other video training I have used. Look over intro page ix of the accompanying book to get an over view if it's capabilities. Although it launches full screen, it can be reduced in size like any other on-screen window. Find the small handle at the lower right. You could of course shrink it down to the task bar, but it runs and looks great at both small and large sizes. What's more, you can pause the video at anytime, run you own copy of Lightroom and actually work through the same steps you are learning about. In fact, the image used on the DVD are also included on the DVD, so you could repeat the lessons with the identical images. (The video lessons are also on the DVD in .mp4 and .3gp format, so you may be able to work through some lessons on your iPhone/iPad or 3G cell phone while commuting.) It will pay to pause the first lesson and explore the user interface of the DVD playback software. It's not as complicated as LR itself, but quirky enough to make starting off somewhat confusing. You'll want to explore the LR interface at some point too. The Lightroom (LR) interface is designed around a good, flexible work flow, and the lessons generally follow that workflow. Of course, in actual use you can easily jump around the interface as you want, but seeing the software in an actual work flow is terrific. LR, like Photoshop, is a deep product, and watching it being used is actually far easier to do than trying to follow step-by-step instructions from a book. The DVD comes with a small book which you can remove from the packaging; it's got those small sticky pads holding the back of the book to the box. Just lift off carefully. The first half of the book is entitled \\""The Photograper's Eye\\"" by Michael Jordan (but not that Michael Jordan.) This seems like basic filler, and is not related to Lightroom at all. The last half is pretty good,although a lot of those ridiculously small screen shots are included. The material covered is duplicated in Lesson 1.4 to 1.4.9 so you can at least see a much bigger image. There is also a handy keyboard shortcuts list. The book is also handy in case you want to change some of the settings without reloading the DVD. I have a few quibbles. In general, this DVD is aimed at Lightroom beginners. But much of Lesson 1 (1.1 to 1.3.7) deals with \\""What's New in LR3\\"" which is almost useless, and frankly confusing, for someone using LR3 the first time. (If you just upgraded from an earlier version, this might be more interesting.) Start up your own LR and jump to 1.4 to begin the process of customizing your setup. At 1.4 you get a really useful, well explained review of the many LR settings. If you start with the 'Play All' option, as recommended, the interface takes you automatically from lesson to lesson, although there is no visual indication of which lesson and chapter number you are actually on. The titles are shown on the right hand sidebar (Chapter Videos) if you open it, but not the lesson numbers. You can use the dropdown at the top of the main dialog to see this, however. You can choose specific lessons from the opening main screen if desired. As you go, you can set bookmarks for sections you might like to revisit. All you bookmarks are available from one of the tabs at the top... a really nice feature! If you truly are a Lightroom beginner, this DVD will get you up-and-running quickly. If you have used Photoshop, and Camera Raw (CR) in particular, you will quickly see how adjustments in LR are so similar to CR, with LR adding so much more in terms of automation, asset management etc. Quirky start-up aside, this is an easy 5 star rating!"
5,"I read a previous review but find my experience to be much different. Perhaps due to the fact that I was not a user of a previous version. I was introduced to the product by a colleague. After she reviewed with me the features of the product, I decided to purchase for myself. I have found that that there is very little learning curve to begin using the product effectively. The navigation is easy and the accuracy of reporting, averaging and curving is excellent. If you haven't used grade book software for your personal use before, I highly recommend this product."
5,This program has hundreds of questions which would prepare you for the test. I felt really insecure about the test before I started on this program. I felt more ready as I tested myself with the program since they had questions about things that I wouldn't pay much attention to. And my score actually showed that I have improved as I practiced more and more with this program.
1,"Received this quite promptly from Amazon.com. Though I have Jasc PSP v8 I was looking for a certain (and, supposedly, superfast) format that was, reportedly, very easy to use with Photoshop Elements. When I tried to load photoshop Elements to my laptop (which is a little over a year old) it crashed my hard drive. After several futile attempts to fix the problem myself (was unable to even start the computer as it was in a crazy loop that wouldn't allow attempts at loading it up in safe mode even) I had to take it in to be looked at. <br /> <br />Techs were unable to find which exact file was corrupt (after several hours there were 100s) so they eventually did a system restore. So, added to the cost of the software I was also $170 out of pocket. Techs loaded Adobe so I wouldn't have a similar problem. I loaded all my other software without too much trouble. Had to remove their version of Norton. <br /> <br />Anyway, though I am able to use Adobe for the purpose for which it was purchased I am not happy with the software. It freezes. It is super slow when it's not freezing. I even have it open with nothing else running and it is still erratic. I HATE IT and it has cost me more money than I ever thought it would. <br /> <br />My advice is STEER CLEAR. Get Jasc's PSPA."
3,"I have used the three top programs TurboTax, Taxcut, and TaxAct over the years and tend towards TurboTax. The main reason I go to the other two is the price games TurboTax and Taxcut play. There is no substantive reward for using the program again the following year (yeah they offer you ten dollars off but you can get that by shopping on-line). I decided to buy on Amazon this year because I wanted to get it earlier. Just recently Costco but it on sale for another $10 cheaper. I installed it on Windows 7 Professional with no issues."
5,"This library is a Vocaloid 2 collection of the Luka Megurine voice bank. It is packaged together with the Vocaloid 2 Editor and if that is OK then there is no need to buy the Vocaloid 3 Editor (you can make the editor use English text by installing it, find the file &#34;VOCALOID2_Japanese.dll&#34; and remove it or change it to another name).<br /><br />Luka is able to sing in Japanese and in English, with a nice soft voice and a good note-span. She can be easily imported to the Vocaloid 3 Editor (provided that you activate the voice bank first). There is a comprehensive manual included with the library - but unfortunately it is only in Japanese. Installation is straightforward, but is is in Japanese so it is a good idea to find some instructive youtube-videos to guide you. Also remember that the voice-bank must be activated and de-activated if it has to be move to another computer."
4,"According to reviews of TurboTax's Home and Business, it appears that TurboTax does not support S Corp (but probably does in the more expensive copr. package). Since many small businesses are S Corps, you probably will need to buy something besides TurboTax...like this program.<br /><br />That is why I bought this product...I checked the product homepage (taxcut_com) and it said<br /><br />\\""Complete Business Coverage - Helps you prepare returns for a number of business types, including Corporations, S Corporations, Partnerships, Limited Liability Companies (LLCs), Non-profits and Estates & Trusts. Plus, the program handles Payroll Taxes as well.\\""<br /><br />So hopefully it will work for me without any additional software. I will try to come back and update this review once I try it out...but since it is from H&R Block, I figure it might not be the simplist program, but at least it will be accurate (they actually guarantees that...although most errors are from the users anyway).<br /><br />Nice little perk is that the software comes on a USB jumpdrive for easy installation...and it also will import TurboTax files from previous years...<br /><br />Sorry this review is not more informative, but after spending an hour digging around for S Corp info, I thought it would be helpful to mention that this apparently supports S Corp Businesses, as well as (unlimited) business state returns, personal federal and state as well as E-Filing... Overall it certainly seems to include alot of forms and features for one price."
1,Norton doesn't work on windows 8 or 8.1. The worst part of windows 8.1 is Norton. It has to be reloaded every 2 or 3 weeks. The last time it was reloaded the Norton tech even said it doesn't work for 8 or 8.1. They also move my registry and program files so bad I had to go bad to a save point and reload the computer. The program is a nightmare.
1,"I have had this product for a few months now. I have never been able to run a successful backup. I am in the Windows Vista 32-bit environment, and the backup will get about 2% complete when my computer goes dark and completely shuts down. I have been extremely disappointed with this product and its effect on my computer. I cannot recommend it and feel as though I've been sold a defective product."
5,"As usual, Amazon shipped the product fast and efficiently. It arrived right on time, in good condition, and the download disc worked perfectly. I tried just using a product key but failed every time. Amazon was the only place to get the disc! Thank you Amazon! You rock!!!"
1,"Whatever you do, don't use this! We tried to use this product this for our business in 2013. We were on the phone with QB's for hours trying to get it set up. We never could get it to work. We called to cancel it back in early 2014. I just found out they've been charging my bank account for over a year, it's Feb 2-15 now. We didn't realize it was this service that was charging us because we also use Quick Books for bookkeeping. I called today and was told that even though I've never used the service and was unable to figure out how to use the service, they are still going to charge me for over a year with them. They only have records of our first two phone calls with them, even though we called numerous times and did call to cancel. Terrible customer service, terrible product. Got Square instead and got that up and running in a matter of minutes. We've never had one issue with it."
5,The product was puchased for my blind son to interact with a &#34;Jaws&#34; program to help him be able to communicate through his laptop. We're very satisfied with it.
1,"EDIT: I used to love the software and gave it 5 stars, but I had to rethink my decision and give a new updated review.<br /><br />I was enjoying this product until I upgraded to El Capitan... I can't get into my bootcamp partition without being pushed to upgrade... I've already paid 4 times for upgrades/full version for round $260 already... I don't think it's right to keep pushing people to pay for upgrades over and over with every OS that Apple releases. I'm considering switching to something else where I don't have to keep paying for upgrades once or twice a year...<br /><br />(Added pictures to show how many times I purchased this product..."
1,"UPSHOT: YOU TURN YOUR COMPUTER/DEVICE INTO BIG BROTHER BY AGREEMENT IN THE LICENSE AT INSTALLATION, IF YOU INSTALL WINDOWS 10. Never before in history has such a 'license' created such awful terms. Look in the comments for links so you can see the language for yourself. I can't put the links in an Amazon review.<br /><br />SERIOUSLY YOU NEED TO SEE FOR YOURSELF PRIOR TO INSTALLATION, WHAT HITLERIAN TERMS YOU'RE AGREEING TO.<br /><br />Installation is also extremely glitchy. About 50% of the installers' reports I've read, are 'smooth', especially from Windows 8.1.. else, glitchy. Given the above warning, I spend a lot of time watching how people in tenforums, wilderssecurity forums, bleepingcomputer and even microsoft community, are suffering with installing this horrible new Windows 10. I do have it, but as an Insider. I write extensively about it in bleeping computer and vimeo PC World Alumni forum and brainout(dot)net frankforum (latter two are my own), so you can read more there. It has no confidential data on it, and the hard drive is removable.<br /><br />I personally own 16 Windows machines which are eligible for this thing 'free'. So obviously if I found it good, would get it for them all, and say so here.<br /><br />But Windows 10, is scary. First time, Windows is scary. You'll have to see it yourself to believe it: at least, I did. That's why I became an Insider, first.<br /><br />So here, I feel I owe it to my fellow Amazonians to disclose the upshot of this awful installer:<br /><br />1. It will only allow you to do a so-called 'inplace upgrade' ON TOP OF your current Window 7 or 8, which 50% of the time results in disaster. People do it, to keep their current programs and settings. Don't bet on this working. Even experts are getting it wrong, see the 1st paragraph's forums. That is also how the free version works. Just avoid this option like the plague it is.<br /><br />2. The other option is 'clean install', which here is only available if purchased. But people who use this, are having really bad luck, and Windows help personnel always blame the seller, so make you go back to the seller. So here, unless the seller sells you support with the license (and they usually do not), then you shouldn't buy.<br /><br />The problem with 'clean install' is the installer looks for a key. The key you are supposed to provide, is a Windows 10 key. The key you get is a Windows 10 key, but the installer often won't recognize it. When you call MSFT for help, often you're told they can't help, you must go back to the seller. So if they are not the seller, you're s.o.l.<br /><br />More importantly, the license is downright frightening. It's so much worse than turning your machine into Big Brother, but Microsoft tells you that you agree to let IT play Big Brother on you, even if you turn off all the privacy destroyers baked into the thing. This is a series of lawsuits waiting to happen.<br /><br />And what do you get for all this? Nothing you didn't already have. Frou-frou that doesn't work: Windows 'Hello' requires a special camera you don't have, Windows Xbox requires Xbox too, Hololens can't work yet, Cortana is a joke, Edge is a gray sheet of paper which gets papered with ads you can't get rid of, your search bar is turned into advertising if you search on the web, you can't get rid of Bing, you can't customize, there is no real Start Menu but instead a vertical version of the Win8 start Screen... and on and on with the nonsense.<br /><br />Oh, and no you really can't revert within 30 days, they overwrite your windows.old folder with the first Windows 10 cumulative update. Which happens, the day or the day after, you activate. IF IF IF you managed to activate.<br /><br />Do you really want to go down the rabbithole with Alice and be much poorer afterwards? I thought not.<br /><br />It gets two stars for two things it does well: it runs old software and hardware which businesses use (not consumer stuff, business stuff).. really well. I use 1980's and 1990's business hardware and software, and Win10 can work with them. Consumer stuff, maybe yes maybe no.<br /><br />The MSfanboy proselytizing is at an all-time high. Which should warn you immediately. If faith is warranted in God or some product, then it shouldn't need salesmen. So if everyone's trying to 'convert' you to it, something's VERY wrong with that idea of God or that product. Right?<br /><br />DISCLOSURE is one thing. That, you need. Selling is quite another, and the fanboys never tell you the many dark undersides to Win10. So...<br /><br />PLEASE DO YOUR HOMEWORK BEFORE BUYING THIS. Links will be in comments after this review is approved, so you can read the license fright for yourself.n work with them. Consumer stuff, maybe yes maybe no.

1,"I bought this product with the hope that I could create neat family photos. It turns out that this program is not user friendly. It doesn't explain the \\""How to's\\"" and it's very time consuming to try to figure out. I would consider myself computer savvy- and this is hard to figure out."
5,LOVEEEEEE IT!!!!!
1,"I have been a loyal customer and bought a full version of PP10, and paid to upgrade to PP11. During the last 18 months, I upgraded my laptop twice, and then upgraded my current laptop from XP to Vista. When I downloaded the Vista version and tried to reinstall it, it says the software cannot be activated. Turns out that they only let you install the darn thing 3 times.<br /><br />THAT IS SIMPLY RIDICULOUS IN THIS DAYS AND AGES. To add insult to injury, they want you to pay full price and buy another full version.<br /><br />Guess what. They lost me as a customer, permanently. I uninstalled it and use the FREE Paperport that comes with my Brother All-in-one printer instead. And then, I discovered that there are actually many free Print-to-PDF products that you can download from the web, such as CutePDF, or PrimoPDF.<br /><br />Don't waste time with this product!"
5,"First for Mac users: I installed this on a Mac running OS X 10.3. It asked me which version of OS X I was running and offered 10.2, 10.3, and 10.4 as options. I selected 10.3 and it went through a preliminary install. Then it asked for the serial number on the card which came with the software. (If you are as compulsive about throwing away clutter as I am, try to restrain yourself and save that card! Otherwise, I don't think the program will turn on.) After I did this and provided the usual registration stuff, it got online (I should mention I was installing in an administrator mode)and had a chat with the company. Everything went very well. This program is native for the Mac OS X and doesn't require Mac Classic or anything like that. Thanks, guys, for making such a neat piece of software that also runs on Macs! <br /> <br />OK, now about using the program. I am the sort of person who gets a great idea and sits down at her computer and just starts going. Things go wonderfully for about five chapters, and then I run out of steam because I just haven't thought enough about where things are going, and it's getting hard to keep everything straight. <br /> <br />This program is like sitting down with a no-nonsense writing teacher who asks detailed questions about characters, motivations, goals, and so on and gives you feedback on whether or not you have enough information for a workable plot stucture and what's missing. (You are free, of course, to ignore its advice.) <br /> <br />The most difficult part about using this program is that the designers have invented a lot of terminology that you have to understand to use the program properly. (There is a PDF file on the disk containing a 300-plus page book that explains the theory and vocabulary in detail. I strongly recommend you read it first! Once you have that, the software is quite user-friendly.) <br /> <br />What I found especially helpful in the software were the dozens of examples of well-known stories that theauthors had analyzed in terms of their model of plot design. That model(this is oversimplified) is the idea that a story is like a mind trying to solve a problem and that different characters are like aspects of that mind at work. <br /> <br />If you put in the work -- and it is a LOT of work -- at the end you will have a detailed plot outline which can be printed out. <br /> <br />If you can write novel-length fiction on pure inspiration, you will probably hate this. If you have good ideas, but find yourself lost in the woods and hoping for a rescue party after about fifty pages, this can be a lifesaver. You get out of it as much as you put into it."
3,"I have just upgraded from 2005 (which I loved) to 2006 with a clean install of 2006 to avoid problems. Read the manual, did everything correctly. It installed just fine. The 2nd day I am unable to open more than one large application at a time, such as Outlook and Firefox both at once. It eats up more memory than both of these apps together. My task manager says it is using 69,692 mg of memory just to run in background. I may have to turn off real time scanning to remedy this. What is the use of having the suite then? I have a Dell P4 with 756mg of memory. It has always been adequate to multitask before this. I may have to dump this 2006 anti-virus for another program. Even AVG and free zone alarm would eat up 1/2 of the memory as this. I guess you have to sacrifice safety for memory and the ability to multitask since I use my computer for work. Unless you want to upgrade your memory a lot, I wouldm't recommend this."
3,"Have only played the most competitive player, Brother Paul. I'm never allowed to go first - at the beginning of some games, Brother Paul will take his first turn and an extra turn. The only way to remedy this is to exit the game completely and re enter. I don't know if the other players have the same bugs.<br />I enjoy playing - however, it's obvious that the &#34;throw of the dice&#34; favors Brother Paul. Especially in casting off."
5,A great program that just cleans up your registry. The registry being clogged from unremoved links to old programs will really slow down the start up of your computer. This program takes care of all those disconnects. Better than the higher priced tool programs.
5,This is very complicated and addictive. Takes you to many rooms and places outside. In and out you go. I really loved this game. Would like to have more like it.
4,I got this for my sister who was dieing to know how to make CDs out of MP3s. After we got EZ CD 5 she learned very very quick. <br />This program is for beginners that dont know much about making CDs.<br />I recommend that if you do know anything about CD burning please use Nero 5.5!!
4,"For what it's worth. I bought this to use in transcribing prerecorded interviews. It has a learning curve, no doubt. If I were to speak into the microphone, I thought Dragon 13 did an excellent job of getting the words right. However, using it for transcribing on poorly recorded conversations proved frustrating. Not Dragon's fault but the copy of each interview varied so much in the interview itself and between interviews.<br />Dragon 13 Premium will transcribe downloaded conversations and it's very easy to set that up. But the results can be hit or miss depending on the quality of the recorded material.<br />Now as far as installs, I have three laptops all running either Windows 7, 7.1 and 8. I had no trouble at all installing the software on each and using the one serial number provided. The serial number shows up three times on the sticker placed on the sleeve that contains the software so I assumed that meant I could use it on three machines or combinations thereof. But no problem with installs on any of the machines and worked fine upon completion of the install."
5,"meets my expectations and more. lost use of my left hand, amazing product. i would recommend this product to anyone"
3,"I bought this program and it is somewhat unstable...sometimes it will freeze when loading and you have to manually shut down your pc and try again, (I run Windows XP on a Sony Vaio PC). When you do get it to run, expect dropped frames on your final video production. Adobe Premiere is much better....they now have a home user version for under 100 dollars. And Video Explosion Deluxe by Nova Development also works better...<br /><br />All in all, you may want to download their trial version and give it a good workout before you invest in a product that nine out of ten times will freeze the PC..."
4,"I hunted a while to find a collage program that worked on iMAC and this was a pleasant surprise. I can do exactly what I want to. I wpuld say the only con is, like most other software, there are no instructions. But if you play with it it will surprise you with it's many features. Definitely recommend this product."
5,I was using Bootcamp before and it was a hassle to reboot when I needed to use Windows. VMware allows me to run both systems side by side. I have had no issues at all and I use it almost every day. It installed right over my Bootcamp partition trouble free. Highly recommend.
5,"Its windows Macroshit, to bad I cant install apple OS X"
3,"* The Install * We tested out QB Pro 2010 by upgrading our 2009 Pro install and loading our company file. The install took about 15 minutes and retained many of our settings from QB 2009. The installer did hang at the end hand had to be killed with task manager (Win XP). * First Run * After installing, we ran QB 2010 and it needed to download an update. This process took about 10 minutes, and then it needed to convert our company file to the new format. Not a big deal, but don't try to load a file from QB 2010 on previous versions--backwards compatibility is lost. Actually running the program, we find some minor updates, as well as many familiar old annoyances. The toolbar is again littered with icons for Intuit products we're not interested in (we had cleaned this up when we installed 2009). The Intuit Community pops up, but you can disable it in preferences. The interface is littered with Intuit products they want you to buy. For example, there is an item \\""Email Marketing\\"" in three separate menus, Company, Customer, and Online Services. We tried this menu option and it complained that IE was not our default browser. (Duh, it's called security.) * Summary * QuickBooks Pro 2010 is a minor update (the new company snapshot is nice, the new products they're trying to sell you are not) feature-wise. The software works well enough to tolerate and everybody uses it. Accountants know it. This is why we use it. We wish there was another option for us as Intuit is not a customer-friendly company in our opinion. They try to hard to get you to pay for minor features that should be included. They should spend more focus on the customer experience and let the revenue streams follow, not vice versa."
1,"Product does not work. Tried it on 4 different computers, running XP pro / Vista Ultimate. Also tried to exchange and get a different disc. Still did not work. Game fails after you select your character and enter your name. Just watch the game show and save yourself the grief. If you are going to buy it at Target, just flush your $20 down the toilet because they will not take it back after you have opened the box. I thought I would try this one after the home DVD game didn't work. Just steer clear of anything created by Encore or Sony Entertainment."
5,"Very nice product, run Windows apps natively in your Mac!<br />Perfect for games and development apps.<br />Hopefully it gets free updates!"
5,easy to use
1,"This is a failed attempt at a good idea. I this software was crude, and not vary flexible or scalable. It lock-up my PC on several occasions, so I finaly had to unistall it to get a little piece of mind. I much prefer Quicken or Broderbund."
5,Another great product from Norton. I've been using it since I got my first computer and had no problems at all.
3,Never got my computer system set up
4,I installed Windows 8 on two computers and both boot faster and are much quieter. The interface has some pros and cons but the overall integration between computers and Sky Drive now makes Windows a good integrated solution. I am waiting to see what happens with Widows Surface Pro to see if it is time to trade in my Ipad 2 for something that can run full desktop software along with apps.
4,"Poser wasn't quite what I expected. I thought it would be very focused on figures, human and otherwise; but in fact, it's a surprisingly full-featured 3D rendering program.<br /><br />As far as sample content goes, yes, there's quite a lot of it, and it's surprisingly varied. Once I'd put together a quick scene of a wolf eating potato chips, I decided to see whether I could pull in 3D models downloaded from the Internet. Happily, the answer is yes--Poser will read a number of common 3D file formats, so you can trawl the Internet for free models of sci-fi spaceships, Japanese Manga characters, or whatever else you want to incorporate into your artistic endeavors.<br /><br />Obviously there are lots of things you can't do with Poser. It doesn't give you complete control over rendering, and it's not a solid modeling package or NURBS mesh editor. But it'll give you the chance to make some images or animations, and see if you're ready to go further.<br /><br />The thing is, I've toyed with various free 3D tools over the years, from POV-Ray to Blender. Poser has almost all of them beat as far as UI approachability is concerned, and with the sample content and tutorials is an excellent place to start if you have an interest in 3D graphics. Yet even without an unapproachable interface in the way, I've come to realize that 3D is really hard and very time consuming to get just right. I don't think it's for me. But it could be for you, and here's a way to find out."
5,"Thanks for the great service and for providing me with a superior product. I am impressed that at a busy time of year service remained out standing, thanks again, peace"
3,"I used this product last year and was \\""very\\"" happy with my personal tax return process. I was not as happy with it for my small business. It was not user friendly on any of the corporate issues! I had to go to an accountant to figure out my s corporation taxes. I \\""would\\"" buy it again for personal taxes, but unless they have improved the product, I amm so so about using it for my business."
5,"This is fun and effective learning tool. My 1 1/2 year old loves this. She already familiar with some of the \\""Suessville\\"" characters from being read to. She find s this game entertaining and she's able to recognize some of the characters here from the books. I highly recommend this product."
5,Received on time and as advertised
5,I'm able to run Windows 8 using just 1 CPU core and 2 GB of RAM without a hitch. Smoother than Windows 7 in Fusion 4.
4,i have some older card programs which has a small selection of cards to make. this one has a really big selection of cards to make in all catagories. this is one of the best card making programs that i have got.
5,"If you're serious about photographic imaging, then you owe yourself the pleasure of at least running the trial of this software. While there are other choices, including Photoshop itself, nothing beats the ease of use and quality of output offered by PhotoMatix. If you make a living with a camera and are capable of bracketed raw frames, you have absolutely nothing to think about. Adding HDR Imaging to your menu of services (great for natural light, flashless indoor shoots) will no doubt add to your income ability. A great product for beginners and veterans alike!"
5,"I have been using the product for over a month and half and just now am I finally experiencing noticeable results. My ability to hold and manipulate information in my head is better. For example, Math is coming to me much easier. I've noticed that I need to write out my problems less and can finish them in my head. This is great for me because just two 2 years ago I dropped out of calculus but now Im doing fine. Another thing, for the longest time I hit a wall with my reading speed (I bought sofware for that too) but now that is starting to increase once more. The best way to describe it is that things are growing clearer.<br /><br />Now for the bad. The software is very basic. For most, the exercises will probably too boring to do every day. This has been my experience trying to get friends to use it. And in my opinion, ten minutes a day isn't enough. I've been using for about an hour a day. The way I look at it is there will always be a diet that works or a method that gets you rich or a philosophy that makes you happy and there will always only be a few individuals that have the drive to become better. Without being too preachy, this software is for the individual that understands the importance of intelligence in succeeding at life and has the drive to do something about it.<br /><br />Edit: It has been 3 years since using the program. Now that I am aware of what is out there and free websites that offer similar brain training, the price is too expensive to justify purchasing. Dual-n-back, a short term memory training program, has been more effective and more importantly there are free versions available. Another name to look up is Harry Kahne and his coarse in Multiple Mentalism. Both programs are very rigorous but produce results over time."
3,"Upgraded from Outlook 2003. It has some nice features but email management is very slow. (Delete, transfer to folders, etc...)"
4,great price on amazon for this combo. payroll is for 1 year subscription to the service. installation was a little difficult and annoying since i upgraded from the quickbooks simple start version but i went through the same annoyances with installing simple start. i was able to figure it out in the end and migrated my old information to my new instance. pro is pretty nice but i needed a book to help get me get through proper flow/use of its functions.
3,"This game I played when I was a child. Wanted to shared this with my 5 years old son. But had a really hard time trying to play it because of the specification for the PC. Really old, should upgraded it for new pc"
5,"same great product and works with Win 7 , old files still good"
3,I've found some issues with Win 7 and the internet. I was trying to click a choice on a site but it was invisible using Win 7. It was visible using XP. I've also had a number of circular dog chasing his tail kind of things with internet sites that I never saw under XP. My all-in-one Canon printer/scanner/fax will only do printing with Win 7. Using Vista both Print and Scan worked. I use Trellix site builder and under XP I had all the text functions but with Win 7 they are either missing or don't work right. I'm inclined to think the internet sites are right and Win 7 is either wrong or very unforgiving of software variations. The first DVD players failed to work with all discs and the first HD decoders locked up or wouldn't work with some signals. Eventually the range of acceptable signals was widened. Maybe 3 years down the road Win 7 will get there. I have none of these problems with Apple OSX.
5,I have used Quicken for years and would not be without it. Quicken makes my live easier with all the special features. Makes bill paying and tracking a snap.<br />Darlene
4,It worked great and I had no problems installing it on my lab top for home use. It made it easier to have for all in the household.
5,I had to upgrade from my great Windows XP SP-3 due to M$ ceasing its' support thereto. Rather than go with 8 or its' relatives I went with this and I had to tell you that this system works/runs great!!
5,"I love the Cake Mania Series. This one is my favorite of all of them so far (there are five). The graphics are good, and the cake details and the cake making tools are the best of all the games so far. I have yet to be able to upgrade all of the items in the bakery, though. I'm beginning to wonder if it's even possible, after playing through the game four times. But, regardless, this game equals hours and hours of fun and yummy cakes that I can bake but don't have to eat!"
5,"This High-End TurboTax Software is especially useful for those who day trade stocks. If your account is with TD Ameritrade the software does all the work for you. Downloads transaction file, processes data & compiles work sheets, then completes the forms that need to be submitted to the IRS. Some special transaction may need to be tweaked manually but overall does about 99% of the work required to complete IRS captial gains forms."
4,it's really bad sound/resolution quality but the full movies either way...
5,"I haven't loaded the program yet, but it's an upgrade from my old one and I'm sure it'll work just as well."
4,"Have a Compaq CQ60-420US that was running Linux, wanted to get back to Windows. Installed this really easily and only had to update the wireless driver to get everything working properly."
5,I am a PC and Network tech and I provide my clients with this solution for years. Simply put. its the best solution out there.
5,"I used Visio for years (several years ago) but migrated to web-based diagramming solutions like Gliffy, Diagramly, Flowchart, Bubbl, and Mindomo for all of my diagramming needs. When I found myself missing Visio, I decided to see what alternatives I could find before making the $500+ investment. (I'd need at least the Professional, if not the Premium version.)<br /><br />In search of a Visio alternative I found SmartDraw. I took the 7-day trial but didn't need the 7 days. I purchased it (digital download only), for a reasonable $197, the moment I finished my first project. I can honestly say that SmartDraw is worth every penny if you spend any time at all working on flow charts or diagrams. Plus, they also have mind maps, decision trees, Google map integration, genograms, all kinds of visuals - I'm sure I haven't even discovered all of the features there actually are.<br /><br />It's super easy to use.<br />If you need to open .vsd files (visio), you'll need enterprise."
1,"I had problems with the WinZip System Suite software, which I bougth from Amazon earlier and which corrupted my registry, and I was going to fix it with Windows XP Recovery Boot Disk CD. It didn't work. I folowed the instructions which came with the disk, but it didn't help. There was no other instructions and no Web site where I could go for help. That's why I consider the disk of no use and would like to return it for credit.<br /> Sincerely, Eugene Drapkin."
5,"I used this product to replace Nero 6. It does everything I need to do and lacks nothing. I am just a casual user, but I can't see paying the bigger price for the full version when this cheap version works just as good!"
5,Definitely going to be upgrading this adobe is one of my favorite soft-wares for editing photos.
1,"What a piece of kr@p. Kaspersky Internet Security v14.0.0.4651 is supposed to automatically download updates. It doesn't. When it can't launch, it asks to send a report. It fails (every time). Thankfully, I got this garbage program with a new laptop and didn't lay out more money for it. Love or hate McAfee or Norton, they at least can do the easy stuff which is beyond Kaspersky. Save your money. Check if your cable provider has 'free' anti-virus software. I know Comcast and Bright House do. Kaspersky is the worst I've seen in my 20+ years doing this. Use anything else. I'm running an i7 laptop with Windows 8.1, in case you're wondering."
5,"We purchased photoshop elements 6 a while back and upgraded to photoshop elements 7 recently. My wife and I really like the rich feature set and flexibility of this product. We also purchased a tutorial and are learning new things about it every day. We love the automatic download from camera, red-eye removal picture sharpening and other standard features. We have also amazed ourselves using a feature that empowers you to extract the \\""good\\"" part of photo #1 and use it to replace the \\""bad\\"" part of photo #2. This has been useful when taking multiple pictures of a small group of people where somebody is always looking the wrong way or has their eyes closed or whatever, and replacing that person with their image from a photo that is much better. We really like this product and continually are learning new things about it.<br /><br />The only downside we have noticed is that it takes several seconds longer for Photoshop Elements 7 to come up onto the screen than its predecessor. A small obstacle to overcome for all the benefits."
4,ive used kaspersky internet security for over 3 years never had a problem with it set up was very weird it had to shut off my computer and do it from there not just install and go like before. also after like a week of use it said the activation code expired! ive waited for like 3 days before it would submit the activation code given on the envelope. have been using for like a month and its all good so far:)
1,Save your money. Unless you are 12 and starting a lemonade stand business you are wasting your money. Not to mention that the interface is simply horrible and to say it is user-unfriendly is being kind. Do not buy.
5,"I've always used Norton's, and it's never failed me. We have three computers, so this is perfect."
5,lots of fun
5,"I've been a longtime fan of Rosetta Stone's language-learning programs; these people clearly understand how the human mind learns new skills. They put a lot of work into producing high-quality products.<br /><br />This set comes in a very colorful package that will be a delight for kids to open. It includes a hardcover book for them to play with while parents install the software and set up the online subscription, and works on desktop, laptop, or tablets.<br /><br />My nephew has been decidedly unexcited about learning to read in his school programs, but this is going to be lots of fun and very helpful for him. Kids need a reason to learn, they need to see why it will be fun for them and not just another thing that adults are telling them to do. I hope his younger brother will be interested in checking this out too!<br /><br />If you're looking for a holiday gift for children in your life that will be more than just a toy, this is an excellent option. It will enrich their lives in the long-term, but on Christmas morning still looks like a fun and colorful book set (cuz nobody wants to be the one who gave that &#34;educational&#34; gift that gets tossed aside immediately)."
5,Great!
3,It doesn't work on windows 7 just give a blue screen of death. I have tried everything possible with no results. I don't recommend it. Dan Olson
1,"It only takes a mere seconds. And suddenly you're experiencing high blood pressure that registers in the danger zone. But you won't mind. It's part of living on the edge in Word OSX. Want to play? Follow these directions. Simply install Microsoft Word's OS X in two of your networked Macs. Almost instantaneously you'll feel a little flush come to your face when the screen reads: \\""ACCESS DENIED. YOU'RE ONLY PERMITTED TO RUN ONE COPY OF WORD X.\\"" HOW THOUGHTFUL! Because everybody I know who has two home computers would surely want to spring another [$$$] for the exact same product. This program is supposed to assist me in my work. Not spy on me. Microsoft they never quit. I mean it's really amazing. I don't need big brother. I need an assistant. And because Microsoft is so fun loving...get this... it actually opens the program and then does it's song and dance about how it will now quit. FOR BLOOD PRESSURE THAT COULD BE BETTER MEASURE USING THE THE RICTER SCALE THIS IS THE ONLY PRODUCT YOU'LL EVER NEED. IF YOU WANT A DECENT WORD PROCESSING APPLICATION GO COREL OR ' THINK WORD' THEY'RE CHEAPER AND THEY CAN BE SAVED AS WORD. DOC DOCUMENT WHICH IS WHAT WORD USES."
1,"I downloaded PC Matic about a month ago and have used it twice to scan my computer and both times my computer crashed. I would not recommend this product to anyone, Read the reviews and you will see the same people have had the same problem. I had good luck Trend Micro, so I will go back to them."
5,I checked out a demo of techno ejay and was hooked!!!! Anyone into electronic/club music should get this product. Hours of fun and the mixes sound professional. You could put your mixes on a cd and nobody would know that you created them on your pc.
2,"The 2014 issue did not show me the improvements I had hoprd for. I have submitted suggestions before concerning the 2014 version, but have receied no reply. I understand intuit cannot possibly answer all inquiries, but I felt my suggestions would have made Quicken more personal for the individuals needs of users."
5,"I received my Win8 however both external and internal packaging was opened and looked to have been tampered with?<br />Not sure what the intention was but no worries, called MS and got another product key!"
5,Used H&R Block for 8 years. Great product. It's easy to follow and the answers to my questions are at my fingertips.
5,"I've been using quicken since I was in high school and they do a great job, this product takes the headaches out of doing business taxes.."
3,"I decided to revise the review and downgrade this product. I can't seem to edit the rank to chage it but i can change the text. I am at the point where I have it disabled most of the time because of the way it hawgs resources and slows down the computer. Totally defeats the purpose I bought it for. My original review is below: I bought this due to the good pricing (3 PCs for less than 40 bucks) and the good ratings I saw it get on the review channels (CNET and others). I installed it on two computers so far, and the first thing I immediately noticed the singificant slowdown in booting, connecting to web sites, and email. It appears the program performs tasks at boot up which may lead to web site loading delaying as long as 30 seconds. Also, the second install (second computer) did not work. It caused the computer to crash and I had to reinstall the software completely. I do not know if it counted that install as my third copy or not. My crashes have become more frequent now and I know this is related to the new software somehow. Bottom line, it does seem to catch viruses and spyware well but slows down computer too much, and they don't give you controls to disable certain tasks to speed up operations. May work for the basic user but the advanced user who wants to balance protection and performance will just not be satisfied!"
5,"I was thrilled when I found out I could use this program on Windows 8. Best program ever. I've had Corel, Photoshop, etc...nothing compares to this program. It's powerful, yet easy to understand."
1,I could not get Calendar Creator 9 to install on my Dell using Windows XP.

1,"This disc does not do what it advertises. My son's computer could not boot from this disc, and after attempting to do so, the computer does not even turn on any longer. I would be very cautious before inserting this disc in any computer that it still able to turn on. My advice is to pay the extra money and purchase the manufacturer restore cd instead. Unfortunately, this was not only a waste of money, but may have damaged the computer beyond repair."
5,"I've used Maximizer off and on since the 80's. Sometimes I've used other things because I hoped \\""something better\\"" would come along (Like Outlook finally growing up, or ACT! getting its act together. I've kept coming back to Maximizer simply because it does more, and does it better. The drawback to Maximizer is that there is little \\""if you are a ________, do things this way...\\"" kind of information. There are basically 4 was to approach the system on a day to day basis, and a user needs to decide which approach is their best one and stick with it. One can manage the information by person (like ACT!) or by Company or by sales Opportunity or by Tasks. These are not mutually exclusive -- you can do all of these things simultaneously, its just best to pick one to be your perspective on life! For example, if your perspective is \\""individual person\\"" then be assured you can start with a person and easily manage all related documents, conversations, emails, to-do items, opportunities, appointments, calls, etc. for that person. If you are managing opportunities, you can likewise easily manage all the people, documents, calls, etc. The most powerful part of Maximizer is that it can fit into YOUR sales process. The most difficult part of Maximizer is that it expects YOU to have the process for it to adapt to. Success with Maximizer is all about having a process. If you have one -- this system will maximize it beautifully. (Current version is 9)"
3,Had to upgrade to Premier!!! What a rip off.
5,"It works great. I had no issues installing or using TurboTax this year. I'm not sure what this... business is that everyone is complaining about but as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing I can't do with my PC that I couldn't do before so if it ain't broke--why complain?alled, but time will tell. Thanks Turbotax for WASTING my time and money.gh, that the new activation scheme caught me a bit by surprise. I can, however, understand why Intuit thinks they have to resort to these measures to protect their intellectual property. I don't seriously believe that their product installs spyware on my machine. Just about any application that is installed on a PC will load some kind of component into memory, and I do have the ability to remove anything on my PC that I don't want there.<BR> Since I haven't fully used the product, I can't really rate the 2002 version. If my experience is the same as in past years, it will get another 5 star rating, as I usually get a nice refund. I prefer to try it out and see how things go before pushing the panic button. For all those people out there that don't like the product, uninstall it and ask for a refund. It's your money, you should be happy with what you get. Good luck.s in Mountain View, CA. I have written each, requesting an immediate refund for a product I refuse to use. I copied information I found on the web discussing negative aspects of this copy protection, and included that with my letters, in case these executives needed to know why I was so upset.<br />Perhaps Intuit will respond with a more tolerable copy protection plan when enough people demand refunds, and express their dissatisfaction with the product."
3,"The game was O.K. I wish the game allowed you to rename the property names. In conclusion, the game was O.K."
4,"I recently switched to a Mac from Windows, and needed a good Mac program for working with photos. Photoshop Elements is that program. My only problem was finding out how to access each function. I believe Photoshop Elements would be a lot easier to work with if you aren't used to another program like Corel Paint Shop Pro XII. The fact is that Photoshop Elements is a very powerful, complete featured photo program, but it isn't at all intuitive and requires a pretty steep learning curve. Fortunately, Adobe offers some excellent tutorials to help you learn."
4,I liked the old menus better. I guess I will just have to learn how to navigate this new system!
1,"My son loves this program; I think he discovered it at school. We were sorely disappointed, after ordering it, to find that the Mac version works only in the classic operating environment, not on OSX. Don't buy the Mac version unless you have an ancient computer to run it on."
4,the software worded as needed. it was a good by for the price. item is recommended for the writing needs.
5,Windows 8 is actually very nice once you get use to it. I like it even better than Windows 7.
3,"I think this is a great source of knowledge for kids, however my son gets bored easily with it, of course 11 year olds get bored soon when the game is not interesting, and that seems to be the case, the characters should be a little more interesting, but overall, at least 20 minutes of playing with it, is a good way for your child not to waste time watching TV."
5,It just keeps getting easier. What else is there to say? I won't use anything else. I just love it!
3,"For a long time I was an enormous fan of Adaptec and their Easy CD Creator program. The name truly says it all; \\""EASY!\\"" This program is so user-friendly, never crashed on me and never burned me a frisbee. When I purchased my first CD burner it came with version 4.0 (I think that was the version number). Some time ago I purchased the Platinum edition at full price because I enjoyed the earlier version that came with my burner. I installed Platinum and was in heaven! This thing is loaded. <br />Now I know that most of you reading this haven't gotten past my initial remark that, \\""for a long time I WAS and enormous fan...\\"" If you're wondering how a program that seems to be so user friendly, so loaded with options, so stable and so well designed could lose the admiration of a long time fan, I'll tell you.<br />A few months back I purchased a new TDK CD burner. The burner came with Nero 5.0 burning software. I had heard of Nero but was completely unfamiliar with it. I installed it and hated it. It was not half as user-friendly as Easy CD Creator and that part frustrated me. I read that Nero was also loaded with cool features but the problem was, I couldn't figure out how to work them. The help screens in the program were lame and it came with no manual. Frustrated I returned to my Easy CD Creator program and installed it again. Something terrible then happened; neither programs would work right. Things started to crash. I browsed the Net to find answers and discovered that Nero and Adaptec absolutely cannot co-exist on the same machine. This fueled my hatred for Nero even more. Eventually I had to completely re-format my hard drive and start over. This time I installed Adaptec exclusively. But then I discovered something else. My new burner was NOT supported by Adaptec and so nothing worked quite right. I re-formatted again and installed Nero. I was hacked (in the \\""mad\\"" sort of way, not that I was actually hacked, physically or electronically - ok, just a brief point of clarification there for our viewers)! But if I was ever going to be able to burn CD's with my new burner I knew that I would have to learn Nero.<br />To make a long story short, I discovered the joy of Nero! It is a fantastic program and, in my opinion, it's much better than Adaptec software any day! The only gripe I have is that it is not as user friendly, however the options and features are fantastic! You just have to commit some time (and a few frisbees) to figure out what the heck you're doing.<br />But there's more to the reason why I so dislike Adaptec now. Over time I have discovered that a lot of the CD's created with Adaptec do not operate well on all other computers or audio devices. In fact, some CD's I'd made with Adaptec caused Windows to crash when I tried to access them on other computers. Since I started with Nero, and put the effort into learning how to use it properly, it is so much better! I have yet to see a machine that rejected a disk I made with Nero, but Adaptec flopped often. I think the reason why I didn't notice the problems with Adaptec for so long is because I was predominantly playing and accessing disks made with Easy CD Creator on machines that also had Adaptec.<br />Adaptec software has a lot of fantastic features and they are easy to use and the program comes with a great manual! I will say that the VCD maker works nicely and burning a regular audio CD works well. If this is predominately your usage intentions then you will be happy with the program. However, when it comes to making things like MP3 CD's or even just data CD's you may be in for some headaches. Not necessarily if your burning them and using them on the same system, but if you try to use the disk on another computer without Adaptec software, or sometimes even with it, you might discover what I'm talking about.<br />Anyway, all of that to say that there are positives and negatives about this program. Perhaps your experience will be different. I just know that I really dig Nero now! Granted, it was a bit of a headache to learn how to use (and some features I am still learning how to use), but it is very stable and makes perfect copies of anything. You will just have to determine what's more important to you; ease of use or actually being able to use what you created. For me the latter won the coin toss! Good luck!"
5,"I generally think of Acrobat as a product to make PDF files, but this is so much more. Basically if you want to make good looking content that can be viewed on a computer, in print of online, Acrobat Pro is what you want. frankly, it's way too much for me to utilize to its full potential, but if you are big into graphics programs, you'll want to give this a try."
3,not as good as 2007 version!
5,"I love Norton security programs for PCs. This cheapest version of the security available from Norton is sufficient to protect your PC from many threat. They update and counteract quickly to any new threat as soon as they are known. I had couple times it said that it blocked and removed some threat from attacking my PC. It updates quite often, and I was able to upgrade for free for 2011 version when it became available. For this price and protection, it is a bargain. The security center has all the information at a glance, and it has computer, web, and network protection. It has the function to improve the PC performance, online family protection, and free online backup."
5,This is a great software and works with windows 7.. If you do not have microsoft office this one is for you.. So much creativity you can do with software.
5,Great game. Very fast delivery. Been playing for weeks and still love it. Son who's 6 is crazy about this game.
3,"My experience falls under the category of naive buyer beware.<br /><br />While I did a fresh install on an existing drive (MacBook), I was ignorant of the fact I was not buying a retail product.

3,"I tried to load this program several times without success. Finally, I read the fine print and found that my computer did not meet the minimum requirements needed to run the program. These requirements were not posted up front on the Amazon sale page. I was very disappointed. Love Amazon, but this was a misstep."
5,We own all the I Spy computer games. Both my 4-y-o son and 6-y-o daughter love to play them. They definitely learn a lot and are really using their thinking skills. Recommend them all!
2,"but the ones that have the go here, go there, sprinkles that, pull in inventory, etc etc etc are the ones i DO NOT LIKE. this is one of those..........will be regifting to someone ELSE, anyone else"
1,"Cyberlink Powerdirector seemed to be promising but utterly failed in real life. The program crashed at least five times when I was editing a fairly simple movie which caused me to loose valuable changes. The features are all-emcompassing and may seem impressive but they honestly didn't improve the footage as I expected. Overall, I believe that Windows Movie Maker would easily outperform Cyberlink Powerdirector 11."
5,"the same happens every year. I gather all my info from the previous year and start the tax returns . The wife stays away from Me at this time of the year(jeckle and Hide). Then I start the turbo tax and in about an hour I have done my Federal,Two states and E-Filed them all. It may sound unrealistic but it is the truth. Its that easy to do and in about 8 to 24 hours I get confurmation that the Federal and state taxes have been excepted. I AM DONE! Now the wife can talk to me again. LOL It does not get any easyer than that. I use it every year."
5,"The only problem I've had so far is that during activation for the video component of the bundle, you have to enter an organization name in order to proceed with the software installation, since the other components didn't require such an input, i had to call customer support thinking something was wrong with my product key, they told me to just put the letter A in the organization field and it would let me proceed. I used my initials instead and sure enough it worked and continued installation just fine. The whole bundle has been an exceptional value, I unfortunately haven't had enough time to get really in-depth with the video software, but as the interface and \\""demo\\"" projects show, it looks great. Why pay 4-8 times the price for adobe or final cut, this software package is great for beginners and advanced users alike, you can use wizards or create your own components with professional accuracy and claims to support HD, blu-ray, and AVCHD. Again, highly recommended, I wish i could get Corel's Draw Suite for as low a price as this one (I got this on sale for $50) cause i tried the demo of that suite and it was also a great bang for the buck."
5,My 3 year old loves it. Stays on. Does not get hot. Relatively well made. Five stars from me!
2,"I ordered 4 of these for 2 thermostats, and the setup and install for the first two was a breeze. There are some limitations as to how the thermostat will use the thermostats temperature, but thats really a problem with the thermostat, not this product. However, for the other two I had problems. During setup, the unit kept giving me an orange light, when the manual only mentions either a green or red light. Even if I assumed that the orange light was supposed to mean &#34;red,&#34; that didn't make sense. Red indicates a dead battery, and I used several fresh sets of batteries. I never could get one unit to install. I contacted Honeywell support, and since this is supposed to be a contractor installed item, they will not help. If you do purchase this item, make sure you install it immediately. That way if it doesn't work, you can just return without having to deal with honeywell support. There are reports that these units might work initially, but fail/stop connecting to thermostat in a year or so, so that is still a concern you must deal with."
4,The local hardware stores do not carry this. Great replacement for original product.
5,I purchased this to use if/when I have to heat with emergency propane heaters. I have electric and would not need it until I use other heat.
5,Easy to install and works as expected.
5,"I see there are people here who say theirs stay on all day, but mine do not. Mine only come on at dusk and seem to work as advertised. They are plenty light enough to do the job - the light isn't a soft yellow light though, it's a blueish white light. I got them to put around the house so when we come home to a dark house or go into a dark hall, we can at least see the way to the light switch and for that these work fine. After my first order I bought more and they also seem to work fine, so it wasn't just that I happened to get the only good pack out there. Now I can't speak of how long they last, since I just got them, but if they lasted a year I would be fine with it, they're cheap enough."
5,"we use these on a magnetic whiteboard. Wow they are strong magnets, and look great in the process. Get them, noting will ever fall down."
5,Perfect in our small-bathroom reno. We used all ORB fixtures and this looks great! Easy and clear instructions for mounting; looks sharp!
5,"My second set, the first I got from Woot so I knew what to expect. Very bright, and the batteries last a long<br />time. Got 6 months out of the ones I installed in our hallway, kitchen a little less longer."
2,According to the seller this was the correct part number for my microwave bit appears to have been made incorrectly. The seller did great but the part was no value to me since it would not work.
5,"Working good. Light has been on constantly for months, and doning its job"
3,"I bought this fixture because it was supposed to have 3 lights.It doesn't.That's my complaint.I would not have bought it if I had known this.Also from and electrical code point of view,there is no marking on the wire to show which wire is the hot wire.The code requires that the tab in the inside of the socket be connected to the hot wire not to the shell."
5,"I was looking for rustic and different and this is it. The light was purchased to add overhead lighting to the teen den. They also love it. The antique look and design was a great compromise of style, taste and generation."
1,"Application: The painting process was easy and quick. It came out looking good, considering it is paint on granite. Obvious it's not real but for 80 dollars I certainly wouldn't complain.<br /><br />*UPDATE* The countertop is beginning to flake off. Not on edges or corners but whole pieces in the middle of the counter. We followed the directions carefully, so I guess this is what you get when you go with an unreasonably cheap countertop solution!"
1,It's one can @ the price of six. Print be fooled
5,"I have tried all kinds of filters for our drinking water line - we're on a well and the water is not the best right out of the well. With an iron filter, then this in-line filter, our drinking water is the best it's ever been. It tastes just like bottled water (maybe BETTER!!!!). It is well worth the money so don't let that keep you from buying it. You'll save more than the cost by not buying bottled water!!!"
4,"This largely met my expectations as a portable auxiliary light for workshop and garage; it casts a bright wide 'cone' of diffused light out to 15-20 feet. It has a cord with plug on it, but no switch? Maybe I should have paid more attention to the description or maybe another model has a switch, but I expect most lights with a finished plug would have a switch, and those with unfinished tails I would expect to get hardwired. Its a debatable 4 or 5 star point, just be sure you know what you are getting. Using the switch on a power strip is an easy work-around, so I'm otherwise happy with it after the first week."
5,"Good quality, good price on this moderately hard to find valve."
4,I received one for a gift and it is so handy for senior citizens that I ordered one for my friend's birthday.
5,"Nice and bright, no warm up time like CFL bulbs. We've used these in the house, an open air porch, and the bathroom - exposed to high humidity and they've all been working well.<br /><br />The best part is that the bulb looks like a typical bulb when in a socket. The light shines in all directions - unlike our earlier LED bulbs that were very directional. Great bulbs, highly recommended."
4,"I bought this to replace my lint filter that had a seal on it and the seal was coming up. Without the seal, it cause lint to get sucked into the venting system. This one didn't have a seal, but it seems to work much better than the old worn out lint trap. It is the replacement model for the one with a seal. I was hesitant that it would not work as well without the seal, but it is doing a much better job than my old worn out lint trap, so what more can I ask for???"
5,Perfect!
5,"Fast shipping arrived before the estimated date.<br /><br />Item is as described and was a direct replacement, works well."
5,"My Takagi tankless water heater recommended this specific piping. It's not particularly cheap, but this with the other recommended pieces (3 total) is really all I needed to properly vent my water heater.<br /><br />Do use this over what you'd find at Lowes/Home Depot. This is dual walled so it won't lava-melt your building."
5,These are sturdy and easy to install. So relieved to replace the brittle plastic retainers that we inherited when we boought this house. The new retainers will keep our glass inserts sturdily in place for a long time!
5,Well it does what it is supposed to. Not much really to say about it other than that. No leaks!
5,Awesome product. Love it. Easy to install and use. Like it very much the fact it comes with iPhone charger. Very creative thinking!! All good. 5 stars.
3,"My brother bought this lamp for me for Christmas and told me he paid 70 dollars for it. It was a beautiful lamp, but when I opened it there was scratched on the bottom,some of the metal parts were broken off and it was flimsy. the wires were taped together, also their was two light bulbs inside, this is how I knew that it had been in someone else's home."
5,"We stacked our dryer on top of the washer, but the 6-ft cord was too short to reach the outlet that's close to the floor. Had to buy this one. Arrived right on time, installed easy, worked great, no problems at all in the two months we've had it."
5,"Looks good, works well"
5,As expected perfect
4,"I gave this as a gift for my future step dad. He is 70years old but doesn't let his age slow him down when it comes to fixing things himself. I was worried that he always uses a standard ladder without any one to hold it. But with this product I can feel safer knowing its more sturdy. After stating that I do not recommend buying it from toolprice.com on Amazon. If you were to visit there website and have any questions about the product don't bother calling them, they are not there at all, they don't even have bankers hours. So prepare to email them questions and wait a long time for a response."
4,"Product came very fast and was packaged nicely, Instructions were informative, Also comes with adapters you dont need, but might need... I installed this and it took 10 minutes, at first i installed it the wrong way and the door wouldnt stay closed lol, but that was my own trial and error. Im happy with this door knob, decent priced, comes with 2 keys and it looks good. Thanks"
5,Really like the nightlight feature.
5,"Works great with the right kind of spray can. It did the job, and it was exactly what we needed."
5,Love this thing!
5,good quality
3,"The product is just as described. I will saw that it fits loosely into a hole created with a 1-1/2\\"" hole saw. I just put a layer or two of electrical tape around the insert and it snugged up."
4,Family member said he can taste the difference in the water after I changed the filter. Was just what I needed..thanks
5,works as designed. Provides internal intranet for professional (prestige) line of Honeywell devices. Set was fast and easy by logging into Honeywell home connect website.
3,Thanks
5,Great tool for my outdoor shed. provides enough light for the whole shed and I can find my garden tools easily. Very easy to install
5,Very nice towel bar. Looks great and the quality is there. Will buy more. Really love the brushed metal and we need more....
5,"This was very easy to install, only 2 screws. The LED lights are very bright and outshine my other under cabinet lights. I am thinking of replacing them with the Halo.<br />This is by far the best under cabinet light that I have seen. Now I am thinking of all the other places that I might use it. Not as cheap as some but worth every cent and then some."
5,"We ordered this 3-pack of Replacement Filters, and promptly received the package in our mailbox. Imagine our surprise when a nice letter explained that the 3-packs were out of stock, and rather than delay our shipment, we were being sent the 5-pack at no extra charge. VERY good service - not so common these days."
4,This faucet is nice. It has a low profile that I was looking for. It has good pressure for both the spray and the regular flow. There are a few minor things. 1. The spray handle doesn't always fit snuggly back into the housing after being pulled out and 2. it drips a little right after using so I try to remember to wipe the nozzle to stop it from dripping down the handle to the granite. We did not use the plate; installed directly on top of granite for a really clean look.
5,"This was easy to install. Screw it on and go. Fit the standard flex line tubing. I like the filtration feature, but was really looking for a decent shower head with good pressure. I prefer a really powerful shower, and though not super strong, this does better than any other I have tried, and for the price, can't beat it."
1,"I filled this with water so I could drain it in the fall for easy storage. I put in under my table, umbrella in place, left the house for a few hours and came home to my table flipped upside down, umbrella that I just purchased was broken, and all of the water was drained out. It does not hold water as it says it does. It leaks and has cost me more money to replace the umbrella. Not to mention my table getting scratched up while sliding across the concrete. Piece of junk to say the least. Yes, I put the plug in nice and tight, and it leaks if I just pick it up."
5,I like these only for refrigerators and garage and anywhere else you need a bright stark light. Not good for reading or any mood lighting effect
5,Very loud and easy to set up.
5,A nice pretty glow and the lights are so tiny that they go unnoticed during the day. The copper wire is pretty too and makes the string of lights easy to place.
5,These work great. I have tried others and always come back to Affresh. We use once a month to maintain a fresh washer.
4,"I am not really sure what refrigerator filters are so expensive, especially when they are mass produced. This one works well and is the least cost of any we have used so far. We will continue to purchase them."
5,A high-quality product delivered promptly.
4,Worked for what I was using it for... I could have used a strong gauge wire... but it got the job done.
4,"Easy assembly, nice light. Only issue is that it does not turn on with the light switch - even if the light is on when the switch is turned off you still need to use the touch pad to get it to go on again."
5,"I just finished installing this into an unlighted cabinet-- a great deal of fun watching things light up, cabinet and kids. It took all of 10 minutes to install (most of the time spent emptying and restocking the cabinet). The wire clips, LED's etc all have adhesive backings that make installation a snap. A butter knife easily detached misplace light strips, but for those with picky spouses, you may wish to tack them up with a touch of putty before setting. I do recommend the dimmer (LED 4-Position Dimmer Switch) which makes selecting the right amount of light easy. Everything is plug and play. I also bought a pack of &#34;PilotLights Adhesive Wire Clip for cable management, cable organizer&#34; which gave me enough sticky clips to make the wiring manageable and look professional. The pack comes with three 3' connector cables, which I found just about right for a 34&#34; wide display cabinet. So far so good. Highly recommended."
5,"These lights are amazing, they bring such a soft light instead of all the harsh brightness...I would definitely recommend these."
5,Worked fine with my Hotpoint range. Installation was simple and saved me the cost of a service call!
5,"Looks great. Great price and worth the wait for shipping. I have this hanging up in my library. Everything comes in small pieces that must be stuck one leaf at a time, so I took my time putting a few leaves up here and there where I can. I separated the trees to be two separate small trees on either side of a bookshelf. I really think it looks beautiful!"
4,Does the job well and is much fancier than your standard thermostat. Just installed it a couple days ago. My only complaint so far is the touch screen is not as sensitive as I would like.
2,After doing a lot of research to find easy lift lines that matched some that I already had in my home I thought this project would do the trick. However when he arrived it was not equal and therefore not useful in my setting. My blinds were supported in a different manner than those that were sent to me and had a pushbutton that allowed easy up-and-down access. I've not been able to find anything similar online or in stores. To bed mine were very satisfactory and I would like to find a real match
1,It actually says WALL-O !!???<br />Really???
5,"What a handy tool to have around the house. Between bicycle speedometers, heart rate monitors, watches, 3-d glasses, etc. we have a lot of button cells around the house. Easy as pie to check so we're not recycling (don't put lithium batteries in trash!!!) good batteries."
2,"The plug unit, that hold the electronics, broke apart after a week. The plastic around the screw broke off. Epoxy will fix it. The light should have a shield / be recessed to prevent glare."
1,"OK, this came with the batteries leaking acid all over the battery compartment. I returned it right away. How disappointing. Not getting another one."
5,Super fast delivery. Super easy to set up. Exactly as pictured. They look beautiful in our yard. We couldn't be happier.
5,For my 13 yo daughter - she loves it and I would certainly recommend this to anyone who has a teenager
5,Fits perfect. And the duration is as specified. I browsed in the internet and this is one of the best there is on its kind. Would buy again.
1,"Poor design. Even in the daylight, the bulb stays lit. Only way it thinks there is enough daylight to turn the bulb off is if you shine a flashlight directly into the hole with the sendor."
5,As advertised. These candles are amazing in that they are so realistic. The remote control works perfectly. Totally satisfied with this product.
3,"Looks good, but when installing, it was very difficult to level the glass so it hangs straight. Took almost 45 minutes to level it. Not sure what to expect when I need to change the bulbs."
1,Cheap plastic
1,"Lights flicker and will not stay on one brightness level. Also, there is no switch other than the remote. Who needs strobe and fade effects on cabinet lights? I don't like to be induced into an epileptic seizure whilst cutting vegetables. No thanks."
5,Great product. It is easy to use and results are consistent.
5,"I love it, Its easy to open and close and light weight,"
4,"But it does rust quickly. I would chalk that up to being iron and likely to happen, Also the water is black inside- kinda weird. Having the humidity when running your woodstove is amazing. We can notice right away when the water is out because the dryness in the air. It makes a world of difference. Cheers here is to a warmer winter then we have had so far. Darn it's coooold out there!"
5,exactly what I wanted
5,"really good, my wife loves it"
5,Was exactly what I needed to fix my water leak issue.
5,"Thx u every one for this awesome product , first time I use it it was overseas and I really like it , and I been look for long time till I find one doing the same job here , it's really makes me feel healthy clean and comfortable<br />Thx u very much"
5,Replaced one of the kitchen counter receptacles with this and it's really nice to have it for the cell phones. Very handy. Has the higher current output needed for some tablets. P&S (LeGrand) makes good stuff.
2,The color is very different than what the photo shows. It's more like an light peach color. I am disappointed.
1,Garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ive had these for 13 months and both have stopped working!!!!!! And isn't it just perfect? 1 month out of warranty they both go bad!!!!!! Amazon told me to call the manufacture!! The manufacture tells me to talk to Amazon!! Yet I still have no resolution and two broken NON WORKING lamps!!!!
1,"This soap dispenser was working great for the first two months, then it just stopped pumping up the soap. I figured it was just clogged soap and soaked it in hot water, thinking I fixed my problem it started working for the first few pumps but then stopped working. I got so frustrated it went in the garbage. Don't buy this product ."
5,"Good value for the money. Nice weight, easy install."
1,"Elderly couple bought this product (chrome-colored plastic) after she broke her hip. It quit working (water blocked, dial doesn't function) during her third shower."
5,Excellent product. Thanks
5,easily mounted easy to use
5,"My husband found the product easy to install, and it doesn't leak at all. It has a small valve at the bottom where you can really easily adjust how strong the water comes out. The hose it a little bit longer than I would like, but other than that, it is perfect."
3,looks like it will work ok but havent tried it yet.
5,Bought this after I lost the one that comes with the drain. ( fell down the drain hole ha)<br />This works great with the handle you can get a lot of torque so you have a super tight fit.
4,This ladder is very sturdy yet a bit heavy.
4,"Love this sink, it is stunningly gorgeous, comes with the grated bottom which is VERY useful. ONLY issue is that it scratched surprisingly easy! Never owned a sink like this so I can't say this is normal or not but a little disappointed, just need to be careful I guess."
5,"Great looking sink, modern looking, sits above and below the counter, saves on having to finish an edge on an undermount, I ordered 2 more for my other bathroom."
5,love this faucet-best ive ever had
5,Works great!
5,I love these outdoor lights! I bought two strands to put along our outdoor patio area and they really brighten up the space.
5,"really enjoy watching these glow at night, love the timer, look great on fireplace mantle."
5,I love this bulb. Brings you back to the good old days. No need for a shade. I want the bulb to be seen. It is to pretty to cover up. I am sure I will be back for more. Love it.
5,I was very impressed with Joy Bidet as a company and this product. I have since upgraded to the C-2 and I would recommend it as well.
3,"Hey i have to say that after 2 days trying to figure it out, it works great. one small detail that i think is very important the small lock board that was included in the package did not have some type of box to place in , i had to improvise . Other then that small detail i recommend it to all."
5,"This is a very nice product. It is somewhat small, but was very easy to apply and looks great. I would definitely recommend it."
5,Removes any odors not only from the freezer but helps keep those odors from affecting ice from auto matic or tray ice makers. Shipping awesome!
4,I use this cartridge in a pre-filter for some very hard well water. The water has rust in it. Over a year now and 4 filters later no rust in the lines past this filter. Good enough for me.
1,"Installed by a professional in a brand new home in march 2008, Sept 2013 Leaking at power cord . After removing the access panel at the bottom of the disposal I found all of the electrical wiring to be wet.<br />In comparison I installed a GE brand disposal 17yrs ago in another house, and it is still working fine. Looks like I will be purchasing a new ( different brand ) disposal"
2,Direction are not understandable
5,Price was right and shipping was good. Time will tell with how long they last before &#34;burn out&#34;. Would recommend to friends.
5,I hate they discontinued these as I love these - best air freshener I've used through the years... so hard to find now.
5,Ordered the Cadet along with the pressure switch for my real Kriss Vector .45. It fits perfectly and installed in less than 5 minutes. The light is as nice as the Surefire equivalent and even a shorter profile. The pressure switch is not as good as the surefire though but works fine. The light output is awesome. Nice color and the 300 Lumens looks up to par with my 300 Streamlight. You will need the Kriss light adaptor from Kriss ($35 plus shipping... Ouch)
5,Arrived on time and worked great
5,Perfect replacement except lacking bird guard.......but in 8 yrs never had problems with birds trying to access vent.<br />E Z replacement took less than 10 minutes.
5,This seat is great. Lightweight so it can easily be removed from the tub. Very stable with the rubber caps on the legs.
5,Great product; it worked perfectly with my Craftsman garage door opener. It took about 5 seconds to program the remote to the opener.
5,quality product . easy to set up 3M two sided tape very effective. Got great customer service when I could not get one of the lights to work.
4,"Find these work much better than pads on bottom of chair legs. Just wish they were not so pricey. I have found that they do work their way off too, but only rarely."
5,Good Product. It was very easy to install.
1,"I BOUGHT THIS FLAPPER BECAUSE I WANTED TO USE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF WATER PER FLUSH. NOT ONLY DOES THAT SAVE WATER BUT IT TAKES LESS TIME FOR THE TANK TO FILL UP. IT WORKED GREAT FOR ABOUT A WEEK OR TWO AND THEN I NOTICED IT STARTED TAKING LONGER AND LONGER FOR THE TANK TO FILL UP. WHEN I TOOK THE TANK COVER OFF I NOTICED THE FLAPPER WAS STAYING UP LONGER LETTING MORE WATER OUT OF THE TANK WITH EACH FLUSH.<br /><br />THERE IS A PART ON THE FLAPPER THAT YOU CAN ADJUST TO DETERMINE HOW LONG THE FLAPPER STAYS UP. BUT GRADUALLY OVER A WEEK OR TWO THIS PART SHIFTS ON IT'S OWN. UNLESS YOU ENJOY ADJUSTING YOUR TOILET FLAPPER EVERY FEW WEEKS, I WOULD AVOID THIS PRODUCT."
1,"The light sensor works only about one-third of the time. The rest of the time, the light does not work no matter how much motion there is. I do not recommend this item. This was a waste of money. I will probably try a touch sensitive LED light instead."
1,"I ordered this lamp, and when I received it, the bolt that holds the bottom arm segment to the base was sheared off. Amazon replaced it no problem, but the second one arrived with exactly the same problem! I took that as a bad sign and canceled the order."
3,"I really need a better log insert system. I have a single burner and this stuff just doesn't glow that much or add anything much to the already weak and pathetic looking flames. I think it smells like gas when the fire is burning, too. The fireplace did not smell before I added this product."
5,"I'm an absolute novice when it comes to these things,I didn't even know it was called a diverter, but I didn't want to pay $90 to have a plumber come to my house, so I decided to give it a try. It arrived quickly and was easy to install. I saved quite a bit of money and felt quite good about my little accomplishment."
5,"So far, so good! We love it. It looks great, works well, and allowed us to take the electric kettle off our counter giving us more counter space!"
5,These bulbs are used on the outside of our house in our front lights. THey are decorative and provide a bright welcoming clear light for nighttime visitors. We will be very upset if they go away due to government rules. Only wish we could find them in the stores.
5,This faucet has been installed in our house for 14 years with no problems. We broke one handle off by accident and replaced it from amazon. Great price compared with local supplier.
5,"I am a big Josephine Wall fan, and Crystal of Enchantment is my favorite of all, I even have the puzzle framed, so the tile is just another addition to my collection and it looks absolutely amazing on any wall even if you are not a fan, this is something for every taste , I get compliments for it from everyone that has seen it"
5,works perfect
3,Obviously you shouldn't expect much from a $10 multimeter. It does everything that you need it to do ok not great with the amount that I have used it. The ohm meter bounces allot and the continuity lacks a &#34;beep&#34;. Don't expect much but for little house hold chores this will work fine.
5,Thank you Amazon for the &#34;quick&#34; replacement! This one works perfectly.
2,"Two factors were used to justify the two star rating. First was the cost of shipping for essentially a product that weighed less than a pound. the other would be that it was difficult to apply to the wall, spent a great deal of time fixing several of the letters to make the print acceptable."
5,"These LED lights are really great, I've installed 12 of them in my garage and its like working in a surgical room. These emit a very clean bright light (like a clean bright florescent would be my guess, seems more like 6400K Lumens...if these are the 5000K I guess anything brighter would be like seeing the light at the end of the tunnel).<br /><br />I will be buying more of these in the future for my under house storage area (approx 1700sq ft) once the current florescents start to burn out. I might also pick up another 4 pack and try using these for my spring vegetable grow starts (just to see if they work since they seem as bright as the 6400K florescents).<br /><br />One thing I will caution you of is to make sure you have current tombstones that are non-shunted (tombstones are the end mounts in florescents). This will save you around $20 if you pop open your current fixtures and check, just look up on youtube about installing LED florescents and there are some pretty good video explanations."
1,I work for a.o smith. It takes a lot of work to build these and 99% of the time they're defective the supervisor passes it for shipment. I run between 1100 and 2500 a normal day (9 hours) and I'd say between 300 and 800 are defective.
5,"I love this decal, I wanted to give my boring bathroom a little life and this worked perfect. Everyone that sees it loves it and it's big enough to cover a large space on multiple the walls."
5,I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the Quoizel FQ8310AW01 French Quarter 2-Light Outdoor Wall Fixtures. They are absolutely beautiful!
5,Nice addition to my Jeep.
5,"Seriously, this product is good at its cheap price. It's a light duty auger - I think the length is good but it's not a steady tube. I used it and a plunger to clear clog occasionally, and it works well(although always after some serious effort). The best thing is the price, so I recommend it if you don't want to pay for expensive augers."
4,Just what I needed
1,Does not work unless you have the two units next to each other. Terrible range and you have to have a direct line between the 2 units. Dont buy
5,"Works as described. The audible alarm is quite loud and cannot be ignored. I've combined this GE 50246 SmartHome Door Stop Alarm with the MasterLock Security Bar. While on temporary assignment away from home, this product pairing provides me another level of security in a rental apartment (especially since I'm not the only person with a key)."
3,Just ok... look good for the price
4,"My initial experience with the stool was not great (see below) - posted that review and withing a couple of days I was contacted by Paradise Furniture - the vendor - who sent a replacement stool and an apology. Great customer service! (And my new stool seems to be just fine) ------- Bought this for the shower to keep a toiletries caddy and to have a seat there. Well it IS strong enough to support the 2 pounds of toiletries but definitely not a human. At least one that ways 130 pounds. The minute I sat down on it for the first time, the board at the foot of it just snapped and broke...."
1,"Over priced crap, many better options with more features and reliability are out there. Honeywell, Ecobee, etc.I have been a successful HVAC contractor in south FL for over 15 years and after becoming Nest certified, I dropped the product, after everyone I sold it to complained about it."
3,Chain seems ok. Like other reviewer case was completely broken when it arrived. Did not even know it came with a case but might as well not have it was junk. Hooks seem to be typical Chinese quality. For the money not bad.
5,Works great but expensive.
5,Exactly what you need when there is no place on the valve to place a second wrench. You might want to tag this tool so you can remember what the heck its for in 5 years unless you're a daily plumber.
5,"These decals are very colorful, stay in place perfectly and are generously sized. This wouldbe fantastic if you painted a ponyville scene to put them on."
5,"Just had this unit installed, and from the initial uses, it is very quiet! We haven't put large quantities of food down it yet, but with one HP, I don't anticipate any problems. One problem I did have was that I bought a new sink and the stopper/strainer to match the color of the sink, but when the plumber came to install the disposal, the stopper/strainer that I purchased would not work on this Waste King disposal! So if you buy this unit and are replacing the sink at the same time, make sure the stopper/strainer from the sink manufacturer is compatible with this unit."
3,"Installed new motor. It is relatively quiet. Wheter.it last as long as the previous one, only time will tell. The previous one was made in china. This new one in America."
1,The little tabs that hold this piece of junk in the fixture trap it in and are impossible to not break off when removing them to simply change the bulb. It is not just the fault of the trim but the whole fixture. I would steer away from the Sea Gull Lighting 9452-15 Ambiance LX Disk Light Piece of Crap and find another fixture that allows the bulbs to be changed without having to buy a new trim piece every time.
5,great item works so good
5,Great value on vinyl tubing. This is a name brand that came quickly. It is a good quality tubing that is pliable and flexible as you would expect. Was able to purchase at a substantial savings over other options. Will buy again.
4,These work well in our particular model of refrigerator. Ordering more than one replacement filter at a time helps in having another on hand when one goes bad. Filters the water for a clean taste.
5,"Lasted 7 years on my deck and color still good! Like the other reviewer I don't get all the negative comments here. I had my handyman put this on my silvered, wearing badly deck with full, west/south sun exposure in SC 7years ago. He properly cleaned and prepped the deck and had recommended this noting the cost was worth it.<br /><br />It not only turned the silvered, rough boards a lovely pale cedar color (1/2 natural + 1/2 cedar mix). It also lasted until this to year when my deck had gotten very dirty and algae'd with the SC moisture and humidity. Just got the deck power washed this week to get all dirt and grime off. It's clean now and really surprisingly the deck boards are back to the nice cedar color! Amazing as I did literally no maintenance in 7 years.<br /><br />I'm now buying a couple more gallons to refresh it and re-seal again and expect another 7 years. Worth every penny just not to have to resell/stain deck every 2 years like I did in my prior home when I used Behring or Thompson stain and seals. Highly recommend this stuff!"
3,"These LED strips have their ups and downs.<br /><br />It seems this is a common problem I've seen when buying these strips. The first 12v power cable interface is solid but the 2nd one (that's included in the package) seems to be either broken or on the point of breaking. Not to mention that i got my packages somewhat damaged which didn't affect the LEDs but could have caused damage with the power cables.<br /><br />Remember this: These are &#34;sticky&#34; strips and, if you don't go over them and keep pressing them down (the first few days) they may actually come loose. And whatever you do, make sure there is NO stress where the cable is connected or it will pull loose. An alternative might be &#34;stapling&#34; them into place where the power cables are attached to ensure they will not come off whatever surface they are attached to.<br /><br />How these units respond to very hot weather....I'm not there yet but they don't seem to lose their adhesiveness during cold weather. I'm in Alabama so summers don't get much more hot/humid here so i will update this in a few months.Still, as an alternative lighting source, i have to admit...these aren't bad.<br /><br />I would guess that if someone could develop a USB connector with a wireless switching system (or just toggle switches) this could make any RV, or possibly even a man-cave look really nice.. It's all about the direction they are being used and the angles. Also, having them project onto a &#34;white&#34; back surface has a much nicer effect.<br /><br />Oh, you might want to limit their burn period to a maximum of 16 hours, those 12v adapter get pretty HOT when the LEDs have been used for a long period of time.<br /><br />And, by the way, do NOT try to run 2 strips on one 12v adapter...you will probably get a burnout in 12-18 hours. Already made that mistake in hopes of getting two for one...won't work.<br /><br />I know people are planning on using these in cars but you had better make sure they are secure because, if they fall, and are kicked or dragged, they won't endure it. Tough is something these LEDs are not meant to be.ause, if they fall, and are kicked or dragged, they won't endure it. Tough is something these LEDs are not meant to be."
5,"We bought it as a gift for my friend. He installed it in living room. It is amazing.<br />I didnt realize that it was so especial . Good black painted finish and creative design.<br />With 18 5W CFLs bulbs, bright and save electricity.<br />With a detailed assembly instruction, my friend still spent a whole day to assemble it. But he said it"
5,"It worked - was easy to install - great deal for the price. We have a 22 year old refridge that we've expected to go out for past 10 years; so, I didn't want to spend much money on it. Great inexpensive solution to a broken ice maker"
5,"So far so good, they work, I've used these things for 13 years or more, and now the old ones are starting to go out, not bad for lights that last 10 yrs or more, and this 8 pck was less than the local wally world store"
1,"As many others reported, this blanket, which claims it will fit around a 50 gallon tank, doesn't wrap completely around it. The tank is in a newer townhouse I bought, which I plan to move to after other work is completed inside. So, I looked it up on Amazon and as others stated, it doesn't fit many tanks and there isn't enough tape to completely seal the seam either. What's the point of not enclosing enough tape to seal the seam? Just so we have to buy a roll of some sort of tape to finish the job?<br /><br />I measured the circumference of the tank before buying a blanket for it, so I thought I had the correct product. How can this company claim it fits around one when it doesn't? So I measured the width of the blanket, and yes, it's the size stated, so not sure why it doesn't fit the tank. Luckily, I bought this at a local hardware store, to which I returned it, with no hassle, but the store didn't have anything else in stock, so I left without a water heater blanket. I then tried both HDs and the Lowe's stores in my city, but the only ones they had were the same thing, or nothing on the shelves. I guess they had sold out.<br /><br />Upon doing extensive research now, I've decided that a fiberglass blanket that's so thin, isn't going to be enough added insulation to make my water heater much more efficient (trying to reduce stand-by loss). So I'm looking for a thick mineral wool blanket instead. Mineral wool is both waterproof and more fireproof than this piece of junk.<br /><br />Remember to insulate your water pipes as much as possible too. I know that's difficult in a finished home, but do what you can."
5,Awesome!
5,"Easy Install, looks great!"
5,"These bulbs brighten my day! Fit my microwave fine, nothing more to say."
3,"Water pressure is good and unit does provide a rain effect. I also purchased a longer shower arm with an S curve to improve that. Delta RP61273 Addison 15-Inch Shower Arm.<br /><br />The picture is misleading as it only lights red and blue based on water temperature and LEDs are in an X pattern, not completely lit as shown. Only real complaint I have is that the shower head puts out a higher pitched whining noise...pretty loud. I suspect this is due to the internal turbine, etc. used to power the lights."
5,"Funny how some simple things make us happy. I have a 1950's built house and have replaced some of the plumbing and added to some sections. I love these valves as they are built very well, easy to install, look good, work and are relatively inexpensive. Installation is super simple with PEX a crimper and the collars, even in a tight crawl space. Just ordered a few more for future projects. And as compared to the original plumbing / valves ... they made things really great in the 50's, but way to complicated ... this is a simple ball valve that is built really well whereas the original is built really well but has multiple seals, 5 turns to turn on or off, junctions etc ..."
5,really liked this product
1,Broken when arrived
4,I got this item super fast. And it was very easy to put up. Just wish it was a little bigger.
5,This is a replacement for my evaporative cooler. Even though I have not put it into service I feel it will perform fine since it is a match for the current pump.
5,i will let you know after the cooling season
5,Works great! Should have bought it sooner.
5,The hoses work very well! I cannot speak on their longevity yet as I've had them for a little over a two months but thus far I am without a problem or complaint.
4,Lamps do work on low voltage landscape lighting. Not sure where previous user got his info. Even on the manufactures spec sheet it does not say DC only. [...]
5,Just as expected
5,I bought one of these without ever having tried one and I was very impressed! The unit worked great for about a week and then stopped working -- it just dribbled water into the back of the tank and beeped. I sent the seller (Decorate with Daria) a note through Amazon and they called me back within a couple of hours. It turned out that my bidet had slipped a little bit off the mounting plate. The customer service woman Samantha was awesome and talked me through re-mounting the seat and now it works great again. Recommended product and recommended seller! Thanks!
1,"I work in a high rise and go thru hundreds of drip pans a year. I bought these hoping the advertised heavy duty chrome plating would hold up better. Well the chrome plating looks exactly like the cheaper pans, and 2 sets didn't hold up any longer than the cheap ones. So don't waste your money. IMHO"
5,UPDATE!!!!! Operator error the unit works wonderfully there is a jumper on the unit I failed to set for my electric system once I moved jumper from gas to electric unit functioned properly I am happy with my purchase. I am used to just hooking things up and they work not used to having to move dip switches or moving jumper wires away from normal wiring I am happy that I purchased this item.
5,Is working as expected.
3,"I like the candles though I was very disappointed about the size. The dimensions are correct in the description it's just that they look a lot bigger in the picture. In addition, the quality is cheap, consistent with the &#34;made in china&#34; brand. For that reason I think they are overpriced. I'd feel a lot better about them if they cost 5.99. They aren't worth more than that."
5,Item matched description
1,"Forget ever using this in your car. It has a range of about 5 feet. It really is a &#34;keychain&#34; remote. It's much larger than a normal keyfob. It'll only open your door if you are standing right next to it, but only while waving it around, jumping up and down and cursing the stupid remote. A regular remote will open the door from 50 feet away with ease."
2,"Cart is big.. that is the only pro.. Don't believe it can hold 150 pounds that is BS.. the small wheels broke on me immediately after loading it up maybe had 55 pounds in it, the large wheels started bending out plus anything over 30 pounds and the metal rod between the wheels bends.. also i got an annoyingly super bright red liner not a black one which was in all the photos and what i paid for and what is with the crappy plastic grip it's just waiting to fall apart.. the only reason i gave it more then one star is because it didn't comply break and at least got me home from the grocery store...(a 45min nice and easy walk.. for me but not so much for the cart..)"
5,Great
5,"These are extremely well made face plates. As such a lot more expensive, but high quality well made, on nice thing, this manufactor has matching plates in each of their designs."
5,"ITEM EASY TO INSTALL. NOT USE OFTEN. WORK GREAT FOR 6 MONTHS. NEED TO REPLACE, DOES NOT WORK.<br />(NOTE: BOUGHT 6, 5 ARE STILL WORKING) GLOBE REPLACED ALL UNITS. WORKING GREAT"
1,"These lamps looked and worked great for a couple months, but then the on-off switch fell apart on each of them. I will never buy from this company again!"
2,not big enough wheels
1,"I purchased a 4 pack. So far 2 of the bulbs have &#34;burned out&#34; within 1 year. One has been replaced as these carry a 10 year warranty, the second replacement is still pending. Not what you expect from a product that supposedly carries a 10! Year warranty."
2,a few of my hinges have started clicking after 1 yr
1,Wow! What a rip off! This mop lasted a month. The spray has clogged and I was only using vinegar water. Don't buy this mop!
5,"This is a 3 way lamp that works great. It is a small, and so on the highest setting it wont illuminate the entire room, there is no way. I got it for our bed time routine and so it works great for that. The touch feature works wonderfully. It looks exactly as shown. Perfect."
5,These motion sensors are great for peace of mind. Let's you know if someone or something is around. I love this.
1,"This stuff is crap. It doesn't work on anything. Used it on pipes, they still leak, used it on a boat hull, still sinks. All this stuff is is rubber undercoating. I'd like to flex seal that's dudes bottom lip up over his head but, it'd still leak!!"
5,I work in property management. Fits in our building's Exit signs. Packaging was good. All 10 or so that I've bought have always worked
5,Perfect drop in replacement. Works great.
4,You did what Home Depot couldn't! Thanks.
5,The lamps look very nice. The shades have a nice textured look to them. The shades could have been a tad larger but they work fine. The lamps were well protected but the little bits of styrofoam will get everywhere if you aren't careful.
4,"Great price, but some of the units are off. Not all handles are perfectly centered so if you make a jig be prepared to fish around for one that fits, or at least measure and check your pieces before drilling."
5,"It's funny how you end up doing some of the things you do...this is a perfect example. I had been given a couple of smaller Lava Lites left over from a TV commercial, and as a goof we put one on top of a subwoofer in our home theater off to the side of the screen. My wife and I would catch ourselves staring over at it on commercials or during bad TV episodes or films. So when I found out there was a BIG A** version of it I just had to one-click it on Amazon.<br /><br />We have had a BALL with this thing-literally! We got the yellow and purple based on other reviews-It does have an excellent contrast of the colors, though I think it's kind of a drag not to be able to buy additional colored bottles once you have the base unit. Did I mention it is BIG?? NOT 250 ounces like the ad (That's almost 2 Gallons!)- The bottle is actually 57 ounces, so about the size of a two-liter bottle- a little wider on the bottom and and around 4\\"" taller because of the cone effect of the lamp shape. Patience is a virtue here; it does take over two hours to heat up to the point where it's dripping red ball shapes. Up until that time the wildest Formaldehyde Baby, hydrogen bomb cloud, Area 51 alien, and cellulite fat looking shapes ever imagined form at all levels of the lamp-which is cool on its own! And the amount of activity once it's fully warmed up is awesome as well- it's so big inside that seeing 6, 10, or more balls dripping while large ghost shapes are behind is common. As other reviews have said, make sure you center the lamp-another advantage is with this size one being so tall the actual bulb for the lamp is far enough off the base that you don't need to worry as much about heat damaging veneers underneath. We keep it on a black Paridigm sub for six hours with no signs of damage, but you're on your own here for your use. And the sub if if anything seems to help the experience. And we heeded the advise of another good reviewer and we do limit the total time to six hours, not the eight the one-sheet that comes with it says.<br /><br />Over a month now, and running 2-3 days a week, it's been fantastic. This is a blatant trick by Amazon to make me go buy SACD's of Dark Side of the Moon, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, and a few other classic 70's LP's... and it WORKED! A great talking point, stress reliever, and reason to get slightly altered and turn up the volume. Highly Recommended!"
1,Not true to size. I was very disappointed. Did not fit my toaster oven. Tell people how to measure their pan.
4,"This makes changing recessed lightbulbs a breeze without a ladder. I, personally, hate clutter and it bothers me a bit to store this item since we use it so rarely. Nowadays, with LED bulbs we're changing bulbs less and less. That said, this is well designed and works."
5,"We absolutely love this little set. We bought this to put on a launch party for our fitness studio, although I feel we would need a couple more. It was inexpensive, super portable, and did a great job ! Great product ! I was offered this item at discount or free for testing and review purposes"
5,"This item works great! But be warned of two thing. 1. I tried buying this from amazon and they sent me the wrong hinges, so I sent them back for an exchange and they sent the wrong pair again. So then I had to buy from a second vendor on here. The listing is wrong, this is not a 2-pack, it is a 1-pack. Amazon needs to fix their listing title."
5,I bought two of these and both have worked without issue. It's quick and easy to set a combo and I've never had an issue with opening either of them.
5,"Bought it for my gun safe, it is a nice compact unit that seems to be of a high quality. It has a port on top to view the color of the silica gel so that you know when to dry it in the oven."
5,after installing these lights ( which is so easy) being a plug n play to the cigarette lighter. i love the blue color that illuminates inside my car. i also get endless comments when at the store or gas station. i think everyone should have these inside there car. not only does it look good but it gives you the perfect amount of light inside the cab of ur vehicle that if u drop something its easier to find then turning on the interior lights which can be not only a hazard to yourself but to other drivers on the road. thanks for making this product so easy to install and to use. i will be buying more in the near future for some close family members who want them too
5,"These are great. I have now purchased 12 of these. I use them with the AA Acuvar Rechargeable NiMH Batteries 3100mAH, also found on Amazon. These lights are relatively bright, but as with all LEDs, they are directional. They do not create an ambient light, but work perfectly for illuminating the walkway to the front door. I love that they are solar, saving me money, and turn on automatically. They also give the house a great look in the evening, increasing the curb appeal. We have had several hail storms recently and these were unaffected. I originally purchased one to light my flag, but loved them so much that I lined the front of the house, spacing them about 6' apart."
4,nice flashlight and it worked great. nice feel & color too. I would order again if I had too. thx
4,"Like the slow closing lid. Was harder to assemble than what they described. The paint has chipped already on it, and have not had it very long."
5,"I love this brush so much, that I bought two! It fits in my hand nicely, and it gives me a lot of control, especially when cutting in. I painted a bedroom and a bathroom, and this brush washes nicely. I love, love, love it!!! :)"
1,"Leaked all over the inside of the fridge. Went in perfect. Fit's just like the original, but leaked...not fast, but enough that we had to put a bowl in the fridge to catch the water and change it daily. Spend the extra $12 and get the original...have used 2 of those in the past with no problems."
5,Really like it having the words Door Bell right on it so everyone would know that this was the door bell. Enjoyed all the different chimes and it was very loud so you can hear it form any room.
1,"Complete garbage. Lock keeps popping open even if all the digits are unset. More alarmingly, sometimes the lock pops open several seconds after pushing it close."
5,It was easy to remove and install. Best part is it works.
5,"very easy to install. I do wish they would predrill the holes at the factory and provide a magnetic bit, but besides that... so far this works great! keeps out the roof grit. so far installed for a few months and it works great."
5,Upgraded both garage doors in less than 10 mins and now able to control from my phone (requires gateway).
1,"I had one dog that barked a lot and I didn't want to take other more invasive actions like shock collars, etc. So I tried the Ultrasonic dog bark deterrent. This only worked for about 3 days. It worked by startling my dogs. I could see that it startled them when they started barking. But once they were used to it, it didn't deter them anymore. I still have the unit but won't try to sell it because I don't think it's worth anything and since I would not recommend it, I won't sell it to anyone either."
4,"It does make my wall-mounted TV look a lot nicer without all those cables and wires hanging around. But I would say, install this cover before installing the wall mount. After securing the plate on the wall, and putting all the wires and cables in, you have to slide the cover onto the plate, instead of snapping it on. Since my TV was already on the wall, and there was not much room between this cover and the floor, I had to wrestle quite a bit to get the cover on."
5,"Bought two of these and have used them enough to highly recommend them. Burns through the 2xAA batteries quickly on turbo mode but other than that I can't find anything negative to say about this flashlight. Excellent build quality, great light output and easy user interface."
1,This is in NO WAY the equivalent of a 50w bulb! I am INCREDIBLY disappointed in this! It is about the same light output as my daughter's nightlight. You can NOT use this as any sort of actual light!
5,"I saw this on Shark Tank and was intrigued. I had a broken yard rake that I had previously tried to fix with<br />liquid cement, and even Gorilla Glue. Both rebroke after less than half my front yard. I did the fiber fix wrap, and it's like brand new. I was not even able to get a smooth wrap because it broke at the base with the tines, but I wrapped the top part of that section, and there has been no looseness, no wobble at All! I immediately bought a supply in all sizes just in case. Best buy."
5,"This works great, and saved tons of time in a large basement electrical project I've been working on. I can't imagine trying to just use a utility knife, like I have done in the past."
4,Works like a lightbulb should. Haven't had it long enough to comment on life or reliability.
4,"rite off of the bat the lid to the batteries broke off, not a good quality design. Other than that it is a good heavy built safe..."
5,"Very supple shower hose, and 8 feet(96 inches) a perfect length for my showerhead. Stainless steel works for me."
5,easy to use .. and look great
4,"We were pleased with the quality and price of the faucet we received; however, our experience in dealing with the technical service department at Kingston Brass (George) was disappointing. They were they were hard to reach, were unpleasant on the phone, and did not seem to care one bit about helping us with our issue. They also sent our part later than promised - even though we paid for 2nd day shipping - which caused delays in our bathroom renovations. Speaking with a Kingston supervisor did not amount to anything either.<br />In addition, we ended up ordering a part from our local plumbing shop over a month ago, who received twice the wrong part from Kingston Brass. We have yet to be able to use our brand new Kingston faucet.<br /><br />Our conclusion is that Kingston products are high in aesthetics; however, we will certainly hesitate in purchasing future Kingston products because of their lack of customer care."
5,"I don't know much about locks but I was able to rekey 3 Harloc door knobs with this kit. I didn't know for sure if it would work, but I figured I could use it for other knobs if it didn't. The Harloc cylinder accepted a kw1 key blank and had 5 pins so I took a chance and it worked. I really had to clean out a lot of gunk though. I can't believe how much locksmiths charge to do this kind of stuff."
5,Fit as expected
5,I was shocked that I was able to find an exact match to the finial that I have on my other lamp. The product arrived quickly and was exactly as I ordered.
5,"This is a high quality product and very easy to install, just a screwdriver required. Only 1/2 the price of the identical item sold through a plumbing store. It is resonable in price and it arrived within two days."
5,"Quality all the way around! I was skeptical at first because of price, but once I had them in my hands, I realized I hit on a great buy!"
4,"Is very bright, and just what I wanted to light up the steps of our chalet in the woods but saddly the light stopped working after a few days. I'lll have to unscrew it from the chalet to open up and check the battery."
5,"I purchased this to make some toys for my bird. I had ordered another roll of sisal from a different manufacturer, and i came dark and stinking of petroleum, yet the description on amazon nor the label on the product mentioned the use of anything but sisal.<br /><br />That roll went back, and i found and ordered this roll. Notice in the photo how light colored it is? That's how it should be!<br /><br />I learned that apparently, some manufacturers soak sisal in petroleum, to keep bugs away or something. Whatever it's for, it was no good for pets.<br /><br />So i was pleased when i received this roll, it was light, and smelled juts of sisal and no chemicals. 1/4&#34; thickness is just right for pet toys in my opinion."
5,"I needed to replace a couple simple incandescent lights in my new garage. I didn't care about losing the light cover, so I went with largest CLF lamp I could find under 65W. The light up quickly and provide much more light than I had before. It's also a good holdover until I can install some more powerful fixtures. Don't forget that these are very tall bulbs, so make sure they are mounted on a tall ceiling with no risk of bumping them."
3,This is a cool product I have good comments about it from friends. I get blue for cold water and red for hot water but for red it has to run for a while and it takes some time to change color from blue to red it is a bit slow. Seen amber for a slit second only no matter how hard I work in keeping the water at a warm temperature. But it is a conversation piece for guess when they come over and see it for the first time and even a second time. ;-)
5,Perfect fit and looks amazing. packing and all accessories are wrapped together nicely.
5,Love our new Moen Four-Function Shower Head. Great deal for a great product! And this is made in the USA!
2,is not compatible with current version of z-wave modules. In my case this is not compatible with the LOWES IRIS hub.
1,This product does not generate the lumens level advertised. I compared this to a product purchased at Home Depot with the same reported lumens and it was at least 50 % brighter than the G7.
4,"well, they finally moved the electronics outta the arm and into a separate box...rain was ruining the gate openers (this is number 3)...they replaced some metal parts, so we will see....so far, so good"
5,I love this thing.
1,I only gave it a star to be able to write review. This product SUCKS. Doesn't heat up a thing. Very disappointed
5,"Easy, easy to clean, let dry overnight and put it back in. Never have to buy or throw away another filter again!"
5,"I've been using this to warm myself! --on cold mornings, and/or on my abdomen while holding in coffee enemas. So far it's held up very well, including having survived one klutzy morning when I dropped it.<br />Don't forget it's still hot after you turned it off! Hot enough, btw, that if you've had it on longer than a half hour or so, the plastic switch on one of those work lamps will be hot to the touch. Somehow even though I know it's still hot, when it's turned off I might not be as careful. I've burned myself that way a couple times, but nothing that aloe vera wouldn't take care of instantly."
2,"The pail pictured DOES NOT have a strap! The pail is the same thing found in the box stores. The worst thing to happen to this product was when they removed the strap. I've painted for many years, this is the third pail like this I have owned. I wouldn't have bought it if I knew it didn't have the strap. I should have bought the Wooster pail with the strap."
4,nice change of appearance
4,gives lots of growing light.
5,"Works as advertised, although I personally prefer the Uponor expansion system."
5,Machine seem to be durable and simple to use. Well suited for all types of jobs. works well. The best you can find at this time
5,The seat is everything we could have asked for. It added the final finishing touch to our powder room.
2,"They look better unlit. When lit, the flickering looks fake...like a Christmas three light; thereby, sending them to my bathroom (by the tub) instead of my mantel."
5,"Overall good quality. I ordered two of these. Having the remote is a very nice feature. The range is good, and one remote can be used with multiple bulbs. No setup required for that which was nice. The colors are great. The standard red, blue, and green seem to be the best. Multiple settings for fading between colors is nice. The only downside is that the regular white setting is not the best if you want it to replace a standard Incandescent or CFL. However the main focus of this bulb seems to be color, and not meant to replace a standard white light. Other than that, it works great and I have no complaints. Something to keep in mind is that a 10W LED is about the same as a 60W incandescent."
4,It's a good low cost iron. I normally use a 70w 20 year old unit so this one takes longer to heat up and to make the item soldering hot but it still works just fine.<br /><br />I have found the LED's while a nice idea in general have been useless. I even forget they are there as they are not very bright. I do like it came with several tips.
4,I really love this showerhead! It is the most awesome one that I have ever used! But it only gets 4 stars because it did not arrive on the day it stated it would.
5,"this tarp is sturdy , easy to tie down , 8x10 is a very manageable size . covering firewood , rainfly , or just a barrier from the weather . the price i got them for here was better than the big blue box ."
5,quality product delivered as promised.
4,"This is a great shower unit, but I too was surprised that the key parts were plastic.The plastic fitting that attached the unit to the pipe in the wall felt like the threads stripped when I was tightening it. I added more teflon tape and tried again more gently, and so far it has not leaked. Be careful not to over-tighten the plastic fitting. The hose is much stiffer than my previous shower unit, so it is harder to get it to stay out of the way.Otherwise, the unit has performed well and is very attractive."
1,never worked at all right save your money it is a piece of junk. complete waste of money and time on shipping
3,"When I received my order, another type of oil bottle was in the package.. not the same one as in the picture on the site of amazon... but it is ok with me.... for the truth, I didn't use it yet... So I can' rate it well."
5,I bought this lava lamp for my 6 year old granddaughter for her birthday. She LOVES it! She would never believe these were popular 40 - 50 years ago!
5,It was the perfect thing to save our angel Christmas tree topper! It even came in the mail earlier than predicted.
5,"Love your wood floors? BUY THESE! They are thick and stick pretty well to legs and bottoms of anything that may scratch. Not really going to stick forever though, so lift those chairs, don't pull 'em across a floor. But for my money, the 3M heavy duty pads are the best!"
5,My son loves these!
3,"Works well for standard plugs. In those instances, the design is brilliant. But it needs a little more room to accommodate fatter plug ends. In those instances, it doesn't work at all."
5,"Shipment of this lamp came within the week. The shipping box was damaged in two areas--actual torn holes, but the lamp was unharmed. One of the bronze arms was bent almost straight up making it much higher than the other three and putting on the shade impossible. Fortunately, we were able to \\""very carefully\\"" bend the prong down so that all four prongs were level (otherwise, we would have had no choice but to return it). There was a bulb in the base (night light), but not any others (no problem). There were no instructions inside the box so we have no idea how to replace the night light when it goes out. I am hoping that instructions to do so are available. As for the lamp, it is absolutely stunning!!!!! Beautiful!!!! We are very happy with the purchase."
5,Very bright lights for using such a small amount of energy.<br />Useful in bathroom fixtures and as front and back door lights.
5,"FAST SHIPPING, PART IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED"
1,Did not fit my GE refrigerator as advertised
5,Wish I had one sooner.
4,"I have no doubt this product will last and perform well, but it is not the best quality faucet I have had. The valve trim is quite thin. It was all very easy to install. Shower head is very nice, good water pressure, and easy to change the flow to your desired type. This is really nice as I have had some shower heads where you could not turn to change to a massage type shower or something once the water is turned on. This functions very well, it just seems a little flimsier than what I was expecting."
4,Easy to set combination. No problems in the airports. Like the added security with out the threat of having lock cut open
5,I have used this for years as my furniture is Broyhill Premier and solid mahogany. I never use polishes with a wax buildup.
5,"No more tangled cord, stores and winds with ease. Recommedned to all! We own two and have given several as gifts."
5,Works great..
5,Love my new lamps and they look beautiful on my new end tables.
3,Love the smell but this is a couple of dollars more than product in store..not including shipping.
5,"Work great, one of the best prices around. Very simple, quite functional, couldn't ask for anything more."
5,What a great deal. We recently updated one of our bathroom and had a large walk in shower installed. We really had to have a hand held shower but didn't want to give up the large rainhead showerhead we were use to using. Also didn't want to have to take out tile to put in a permanent handheld one. This looks great and works great too!!!
5,Delivered in great shape. Color match to commode very close. Close mechanism is very smooth and full closure is very quiet
5,The finish is beautiful and matches my existing faucet. The pump dispenses a perfect amount of soap which saves money in the long run and the seller reached out with an email with instructions and a link to register for warranty coverage. This seller stands behind their product. I am very pleased with the product and interaction with this seller.
2,"Quality of the product was as expected. Although there is no way that my spool was 100ft as advertised. I used this to wire lights around the perimeter of my deck. My deck is 16' x 16'. After running this for my feed around the deck (16'+16'+16'+16=64') I had less than 20 ft left. Not enough left to wire the lights on my stairs, when there should have been nearly 40' left. I had to go out an by another roll to finish."
3,"Received the camera shipped in an a soft envelope, in some bubble wrap. WTF? That's what you get for half price, I guess."
4,"I have a wall heater vent that is about 40 feet from the furnace. The contractor that put in the bedroom addition decided to connect the duct to the end of a duct that already feeds two other rooms. In the past, I had to close the other two vents in order to feel any appreciable flow out of the end vent, and still the room was much colder than the rest of the house.<br /><br />Although this model is described as white in color, the booster that I received is closer in color to the gray outlet- and switch plates. As others have mentioned, it is somewhat loud, and removing the inner grates helped to some extent. On closer inspection, I found that one of the fans would not spin freely. I discovered that both fans were not assembled correctly. Specifically, the fan bearings were not pressed fully into the hub. When I looked at the gap between the fan (the rotating part) and the frame, I could see the coils of copper wire inside. Supporting the hub, I pressed each fan down until it seated fully. The blades sit much closer to the hub support arms. I noticed that both fans spin much more freely and the booster is noticeably quieter.<br /><br />The fans are model DFC902512M by coolingfan.cn, 12VDC, 0.20A. This model is not listed on their website, but a similar 92x92x25mm, 12VDC, 0.20A model listed has the following specifications: voltage: 6-13.8VDC, speed: 2500rpm, airflow: 48.1cfm, pressure: 2.60mmH2O, noise: 31dBa, weight: 77g. Tach measurements give the following fan speeds: low: 2000rpm, medium: 2200rpm, high: 2500rpm. At medium speed, the noise level seems comparable to that of the unboosted vents closer to my furnace. There is a more significant jump in speed and noise from medium to high than low to medium. I use medium.<br /><br />While the unit was open, I also desoldered the thermistor from the control board and extended it with a pair of wires by about 8 inches out the back. I was able to thread the two thin wires through the original hole for the thermistor and out of one of the rectangular access holes for the fan catches without the need for drilling an additional hole. The thermistor now sits deeper inside the duct. The unit no longer cycles on and off repeatedly at the start and end of the heater cycle due to the fan blowing directly on the thermistor. There is no hysteresis programmed into the controller, so the fans cycle on and off at exactly the set temperature.<br /><br />The LEDs for the indicator panel fit into tubular guides. You can inserted a small wad of cotton or tissue into each tube to dampen the amount of light emitted, and not alter the external appearance of the booster.<br /><br />The booster comes with a 12VDC, 500ma transformer-type wall wart. According to my Kill-a-Watt meter, it is drawing 1W at idle, 5W on low, 6W on medium, and 7W on high. Note that the fans are rated 2.4W each according to the labels, 4.8W together. When power is reset, the booster seems to remember the last-used settings.<br /><br />This booster fits best if the duct opening is flat and square. In my case, the metal duct extends slightly from the drywall and the spackling is uneven. Due to this protrusion and the design of the plastic faceplate and adapter, the unit does not sit flush against the surrounding drywall. I will have to either trim the duct and spackling flush with the drywall, or adhere a strip of thin foam insulation around the perimeter of the back of the faceplate to close this irregular gap.<br /><br />The room is warmer and comfortable with the booster installed and running. Considering the quality of parts and type of materials used, I do wish it was a little less expensive. I also had to order the adapter plate for larger vents, plus a 120VAC flat-plug extension cord so that it can be plugged into a wall outlet behind furniture. However, it is relatively simple device that can be completely disassembled and is servicable to the circuit board level with readily-available parts."
5,"Very pleased. While I planned to read in bed with it, I'm actually using it at my jewelry workbench for focusing on small soldering jobs. It is very bright and is just the right size to focus light in sideways instead of just overhead. This means a world of difference for soldering and other jewelry tasks.<br /><br />I can use it for reading as well, but since I have poor lighting in my workshop this really made me happy. OTT lights are popular for crafts but pricey and I found that their overhead shining often bounced off my metals and actually made it harder to focus.<br /><br />I rec'd a sample for review."
4,"These work just as well as the ones I purchased from Sears when I bought the refrigerator. No complaints, but the only issue I would bring up us the black crystalline stones present in water when first installed. They wash away no problem then don't return."
5,"Great product. Everyone should have one. Aftter you install it and are setting up the App on your phone the first step threw me because it didn't say go to settings and acknowledge the thermostat. Later it seemed obvious, but then most things do after you figure them out."
2,"It's nice once it turns on fully, but it's NOT instant-on. In general, one of the big advantages of LEDs over CFLs is instant-on. I'm not quite sure why, but the LEDs in this bulb come on in three phases ...bing, Bing, BING! Its a big annoyance for a light that's turned off and on frequently."
3,Like it
2,it works but there is no on off switch.
3,The light never worked.
5,"Best kitchen cleaner. Baking pans, range hoods and anything with stubborn stain or grease can be cleaned with almost no effort. Just spray and wait. Then wipe/wash it off. Love this product!"
5,Arrived when promised and is so much better than the rubber sink mats. Fits perfectly - love it!
1,the lightbulbs blew each time i used them
5,"I tried using a regular 110v dimmer on my low voltage lighting. IT WORKED--FOR AWHILE!. Then I began burning out light units. This low voltage dimmer corrected the problem. It's just as easy to install as a regular light switch. This unit not only works as a dimmer, but also have a convenient \\""on/off\\"" switch. Always turn off the power! If your not sure of how to install this, call an electrician."
5,perfect.
5,2 words COMFY & PERFECT
1,"I bought this rope expecting it to be 3/8&#34;, but it is thinner than that and slippery too. I would not recommend this rope and was disappointed, will probably end up throwing it away since nobody else I know wants it."
5,easy to install and it worked great
5,"I love this little reading light! It illuminates the page very well, but not the entire room. My partner isn't bothered by my late night reading with this light. I don't have to be constantly fiddling with the light to get enough light at the bottom of a page. Since it is powered by AC, I don't have to worry about batteries running flat (although the battery pack is wonderful when travelling). I've owned my Itty Bitty for many years, so I can attest to its durability. Sadly, the cord is now giving way where it is hard-wired into the lamp, so the bulb blinks on and off. I will have to send the lamp off to lamp heaven, and it looks as if a new one will have to wait a bit due to the price. But I know I won't last long with those inadequate little LED lamps, and will have to return to Itty Bitty."
5,Very useful and looks great! The lamp itself even looks better than the picture.
5,"I liked it so much, I bought a second one! This is the smoothest operating faucet I've ever used. The water comes on and off so softly it's like magic. Such fine engineering makes it a delight to use."
5,"Who doesn't love to play with magnets. These are AWESOME!!!! But do head the warnings. These magnets are quite powerful and not for young children. You can find many fun things to do with them but please please please keep away from ALL electronics, TV's, video displays. NEVER allow any small children to play with even one of these magnets."
5,works as advertised
1,I get1 broken CFL out of 4 light
5,"Day-glow paint has been around for a long time and, for those places where you need the extra visibility nothing will do a better job. This was easy to apply, dried quickly and seems to be standing up to the weather."
5,i put this in my niece bedroom over her shoe cubby with a large minnie mouse in heels wall sticker..too cute
4,Product fits and works as described. No issues.<br />Product arrived within number of days promised.<br />Price was reasonable.<br />Ordering process was easy
5,Great bulbs. I will reorder them again.
5,"It's always somewhat surprising to pull out an old furnace filter and see how much dust it has collected over a few months. My particular system uses a 2&#34; x 20&#34; x 20&#34; filter -- a size that is not readily available from the &#34;big box&#34; home centers. This proved to be a blessing in disguise, as it caused me to research what &#34;MERV&#34; meant -- and I discovered that the filters carried by local vendors were of rather low quality in the level of filtration. As an allergy sufferer, I was pleased to be able to purchase a higher level of filtration that should reduce the allergens moving though my home's air handling system. These filters appear to fulfill my needs very well and were quite reasonably priced.<br /><br />In my home, the furnace is in the attic, and the filter is positioned just behind a grill in the ceiling of a central hall. The measurements of filters tend to be slightly less than the nominal measurement, which made installation a 'three hand' situation. (Solved by turning on the system fan, allowing the air flow to hold the filter in place while closing the grill that holds the filter in place.) The filter does not firmly contact the sides of the filter box, but the duct behind the filter is slightly smaller, so that in operation, the air pressure holds the filter against the duct giving an adequate seal.<br /><br />The filter appears to be sturdy and should preform its task without structure failure."
3,Had to make alterations to fit due to my vent's not being original but I painted them and they look great!
5,"These salt lamps are just as pictured. They arrived quickly,well packaged, and in perfect condition. Assembly is quick and easy. Each lamp is unique with a beautiful, warm glow. I will definitely purchase from this company again!"
5,Wonderful product - easy install and no issues with the operation. Product arrived as planned no issues at all...
5,These are perfect and easy to install. Would highly recommend.
5,"I was so tired of finding our bath fan running all the time, transferring our inside warm or cool air to the outside. This switch was the perfect solution. Easy to install and functional. The bottom button is an off switch in the event you want to turn it off before the timer does. The time remaining LED moves down as it reaches each remaining run time step. For instance, If you choose the 10 minute button, after 5 minutes of run time, the 10 minute light goes off and the 5 minute light illuminates until it's time is up."
5,"It makes a noticeable when I put this plastic insulation on specific windows in my house. There is enough plastic in one container to cover a 9' x 6' picture window, and some leftovers for smaller windows. I used 1.5 boxes to get all the windows in the living room, bedroom, and office. The kitchen and dinning room are colder than the rest of the house, but that's something I can live with."
5,great for outdoor use. love that it has a drain for the winter!
4,"This is the perfect way to add an easy, handheld shower head. The initial setup took only a couple minutes, and each time we want to go back & forth between this and the regular shower head, it's a simple snap to take it off or put it back on. It has a good reach, and I love how we can turn it off to save water.<br />This rinser has helped us be able to rinse our toddler's hair in the bath so much faster and with fewer tears, and it also lets us give them a super-fast shower when needed. We use it at every bath/shower for our little ones!"
1,"Does NOT properly fit Lennox furnace! About .5&#34; longer than other brands of same listed dimensions, so you can't put panel back on the filter box, also about .5&#34; thinner than other 20x25x5&#34; filters. You probably don't want these..."
5,"My wife and I got this safe for our important documents. We like it because it can fit a full size sheet of paper (8 1/2\\"" x 11\\""), it's not too big, nor too heavy."
5,OK.
5,"This light is small and lightweight in stature, but very big otherwise. You hardly notice it's on your helmet but when you turn it on the very bright light lets you know it's there indeed! Highly recommended!"
5,EVERYTHING'S GOOD....LOVE IT!
5,"If you use door alarms purchased from your local home center, replacing the batteries costs about as much as the door alarm (which work great). Purchasing them through Amazon saved money and time."
3,"This cart is a must have if you own the 110lb MK-101Pro or similar saw. It makes transporting much easier. Previously I had to dissassemble the saw into two pieces plus the stand and carry each piece to or from the trailer for transport.<br />There is some pretty good engineering with the ATS stand but it could have been designed better, especially for the price. The legs are held in place by 1/4&quot; bolts which I doubt will last long because of the extreme stress placed on them when raising and lowering the saw. The instructions that came with the stand showing the purchaser how to attach the saw are all but useless. The pictures are pitiful. It took me almost an hour to figure out things that with proper instruction would have taken minutes.<br />The pneumatic tires are secured only with an axle cap. The tire wabbles. It would not surprise me if this method of attachment doesn't fail quickly.<br />Other parts are the saw stand show thought and engineering. The way the legs fold out of the way is good. A stand on the end of the saw, which allows it to be placed on end ready for wheeling to or from the job site, can be removed after raising the stand into its working position and placed in slots on the side of the stand for an additional working surface. I really like that feature. With the saw attached the unit is well balanced for transporting like a handtruck."
5,"Great product - the third Oxyled item I've bought. This was for my son, who saw the first one and remarked on the quality of the light it provides. He's doing a lot of reading while working on an advanced degree."
4,"Great for price. Got for my 3 year old when we do family dance parties and it is perfect for that. It is slightly noisy as it makes it's way around, but for our purposes, it works."
5,Had a frosted halogen bulb in a bathroom fixture blow and the CBConcept bulb was a perfect replacement at a great price.
5,Huge believer of changing these out every 4-6 months. Was tired of paying HD prices so was happy to see this on Amazon. These are extremely durable and have the quick clean release which is perfect.
5,"I just installed these yesterday so I can't say I have much time on them. On the other hand though they do exactly what I want. They're in outside fixtures and, with their warm colored light, present a candle light sort of ambiance. There are three to a fixture so the light is sufficient too."
4,"If you need a cheap light with a motion sensor, this unit does the job. it's not great, but it works and doesn't cost much. Note, it only stays on for a few seconds - which is exactly what I wanted. If you want something that stays on longer after you trigger it, try a different unit. I use it in a dark garage so I can see the door handle to get into my house. It does the job I needed it for."
5,Purchased a new because after about 10-15 minutes of turning on the water heater the old one would leak and not stop. Removing the old took some WD-40 and some persuasion with a pipe wrench.
4,"Bought these for a gift, and they were received with much joy. Didn't realize the little accessory lenses actually come off with a clamp and are adjustable. Kinda cool, but kinda fussy too."
5,Happy customer
5,love this design. Wasn't sure I would like it but absolutely do!. I think this design has better water flow than the old design too.
5,It was suppose to be a direct replacement for my 22 year old GE Refrigerator but is was not. The supply line on my old valve was a flare type and this valve required a compression type. Not really a problem I just cut off the flared end on my copper supply line and purchased compression fitting and furrel. I believe the newer refrigerators have plastic supply lines that use a compression type connection so this should not be a problem for newer refrigerators. Also the solenoid terminals were smaller and required an 2 adapters and there was only one in the package. I saved lot on money by doing it myself so overall I happy with this purchase.
4,"I have a 'batch' solar hot water tank on my roof I put in when I built the house in 1990. It preheats the water before it goes into a water heater, and previously I had an LP gas heater, a 40 gallon tank. That system worked well, but four years ago I did an addition and put in a Bosch solar type tankless heater designed to back up the solar hot water. It works very well, sensing the temperature of the water coming from the roof and firing up only as needed to increase the temperature if the water from the batch heater isn't hot enough. While it works perfectly there are two concerns. One is that the solar unit has a standing pilot light rather than electronic ignition; I believe they could figure out how to fix this. Secondly, the unit is small and if someone upstairs calls for hot water while I am in the shower the water gets cold until I adjust the mix, then the water is hot enough. This heater will not work for a large family, though putting in two might work. It has saved a lot of money in LP gas, and I have noticed the reduction since putting in the Bosch compared to the previous method. I can't say how much because I used to use LP gas to cook and when I did the addition we switched to an electric stove, so the gas use would have been reduced anyway. Still, I use very little LP gas on a yearly basis, only 200-300 gallons for home heating and water heating for a 2700 sq. ft. house; not bad!"
5,Fast delivery and good product!!
5,worked as expected.
5,"Converted from our &#34;non-chilling&#34; free-standing model to this one that delivers a cold dring at an ADA height, easy installation, good price."
5,I was going to replace my deck but really could not afford to. When I found out about DeckRefom I was so excited to be saving so much money. In my opinion my DeckRefom deck looks better than new wood. DeckReform is the way to go!!!!! Love it.[[ASIN:B00D7NXNRE DeckReform 3 gallon Redwood tinted deck resurfacer]]
4,ok wish the screws were better
5,I have three of these throughout my home and they are the best on the market! Durable and very easy to install~! Just plug in and done. Price is another plus!
1,"The package says something like 10,000 hours. The description page says 3,000 hours. I don't think you'd come anywhere close to either of those numbers if you added up the life of all 10 bulbs. I've gone through 3 or 4 of them since I received them a few months ago. According to some, you aren't supposed to touch these types of bulbs directly with your fingers. I can't find any solid evidence that doing so reduces bulb life, but I even tried installing the bulbs without touching them. Didn't help. Garbage."
5,Product works as described with no issues.

5,Best heavy duty tarp I've found
1,They did not fit in my bathroom sink as I'd hoped. They were just a bit too small. So they just moved all over. Would not seat firmly.
5,I haven't hung this pendant yet but I love the color and style and I chose it because I only need a 6 inch extension which this offered. It appears to be of good quality and it was difficult to find on other websites...all sold out. Can't wait<br />To see it hanging above my bar!
3,I would have given a higher rating had I been sent the clear light bulbs that I had ordered. But I received white bulbs.
3,"Seems to be OK, glad that it does not go off. Good to know that the CO is zero."
5,Just perfect
5,"These lights are amazing! Warning, if you aren't planning to use the dimmer they are VERY bright. We use the dimmer, and I couldn't have found a better product for us. They do connect together, and they have several settings (different speeds of flashing and dimming). They also have a remote. Highly recommend!"
5,This thing works like a charm. I've got a big house and a new baby and I put the wireless remote sensor in the baby's room and the central A/C turns on and off based on the baby's room temperature. Very simple and elegant. Programming it may seem a little daunting at first but a few quiet moments browsing the entire manual is time well spent. I highly recommend it.
4,"When your Apple charging cables break right at the point of the plug, Sugru in white is the most perfect solution."
5,Great addition to the bathroom. I ordered one for the guest bathroom and liked it so well that I ordered two more for the master bath.
4,this device is nice quality and easy setup. Well simple setup. Sort of bulky is the reason I gave this a four star instead of a five.
5,Easy to set up. Can be easily heard.
5,Got this for our shower and loving it. Very nice looking and easy to use. Just a simple turn up or down to change the temp.
5,Worked perfect.
5,"Even though I did have to return one of the 3 sets because it was defective, Amazon had the replacement here the next day.Seem to be solid and strong."
4,Lamps fit my lighting fixture in the kitchen. I was not sure if the wattage would be too bright or not bright enough...it was perfect!
3,It's great if u got the purse to carry it around. For at home its tedious.
1,"This thing is not made properly. The hepa filter blows hair out the front everywhere. It was not as pictured. It also did not include a replacement carbon filter to go with the hepa filter. And the new &#34;blue filter&#34; gets clogged so easily I have to switch out/clean half-way through vacuuming my tiny house. I'm not impressed. I ordered the parts from Hoover.com directly, for cheaper, and they work much better."
4,"I'm a huge fan of having my shop organized, and these are what make it possible. Overall, they're very study hooks that should last forever once installed. I found in one older sheet of 1/4 in peg board, I had to hammer the bottom peg in on some of these since they're so tight. That's the kind of fit I like in hooks since it means they won't pull out.<br /><br />That being said, I found a few minor quality control issues. First of all, the bottom pegs seem to just be tack welded on. Under normal conditions, I can't imagine this would be an issue, however like I said, I had to hammer a few of these into the holes. Out of this pack, I had one rear peg break off. The only other issue I had was the spacing between the top and bottom pegs. I found some instances where they were more than an 1/8th of an inch too low, or too high.<br /><br />In the end, I have to admit, I ordered another pack of them. Despite the few throw away pegs, it's still a good deal for sturdy pegs. I'd recommend them."
2,It did not fit . Not even close.
5,"The Mandle worked perfectly, it's a very handy tool!"
4,work as advertised
5,"Fit in like a glove, and I have enough on hand for a few years. I even set up a reminder on my PC to remind me when to change them out, and having them on hand means I wont forget!"
5,"Some of the best cyanoacrylate glue (&#34;super glue&#34;) I've ever used.<br /><br />As a bit of background, I am sometimes called upon to 3D print costume elements for friends and family for parties and such. Because of this, I print a lot of stuff with ABS. It's durable, glues together well, and can be smoothed down with acetone. But for larger elements like helmets, I have to print them in multiple pieces and glue them together.<br /><br />Anyway, one day I ran out of glue mid-project. I bought some of this brand at a local store, tried it, and it worked better than any super glue I had used before. I returned to the store, bought them out, and ordered a bunch more here on Amazon.<br /><br />Now, so you get the best mileage out of it, some information on cyanoacrylate glue:<br />How cyanoacrylate glue does *not* work:<br />* &#34;Drying.&#34;<br />* Melting the plastic on the two sides together.<br />* Evaporating.<br />* Pretty well any other method of bonding you've ever heard about for it.<br /><br />How cyanoacrylate glue *does* work:<br />* In the presence of water, liquid super glue polymerizes. In other words, the individual molecules of super glue plastic which make up the liquid form bond to each other in long chains and turn into a solid plastic. This solid plastic is what holds the two sides together.<br />* Blowing on a cyanoacrylate glue works because the moisture in your breath kicks off the polymerizing/solidifying. Touching it with your skin also works due to the moisture in your skin, but this is a very bad idea since cyanoacrylate glue has no problems bonding to skin.<br />* Spraying cyanoacrylate glue with water also very quickly kicks off solidifying, but you may not get as good of a joint as if you let it dry a bit slower.<br />* Because you're literally filling the crack with a different type of plastic, ideally you want to use as thin of a layer as you can get away with. You want to use the strength of the surrounding plastic, not try to add strength using a weaker filler plastic meant solely for bonding.<br />* As with any cyanoacrylate glue, keep the fumes out of your eyes. They hurt. I speak from experience many times over.<br /><br />This stuff is quick drying and very strong. It holds together ABS very well. It also seems to hold PLA together pretty well, though I have less experience on that front than with ABS. But it's the best super glue I've tried.try to add strength using a weaker filler plastic meant solely for bonding.<br />* As with any cyanoacrylate glue, keep the fumes out of your eyes. They hurt.

1,The light does not work...I let it charge in the sun and it still did not work....will never buy one again....worthless and I just through my $20 away....i contacted the seller and they don't care...be careful.
5,"On an item like this, it is enough to say it is very solid and it works. Going to Europe? Get this."
5,I am enjoying the feel and entire experience of the<br />treated water. affordable and effective<br />Marge
5,"Purchased a sink online for a great price. However, it was good because it was incomplete. It did not come with the sink clips, so it could have turned out to be a terrible deal. That said, you had the clips and they were perfect, in fact the same manufacture. So, once again my good deal that I thought had gone bad was back on track to be a great deal. Thank you with your products it has turned out to be a great deal once again. In addition, shipping was recieved within two days of purchase. A++ service and know where to turn in a hour of need. Many thanks for you excellent management."
5,"I chose this because I sorted the customer reviews and this came out rated the highest for low flow shower heads. I could not believe a $5.00 shower head would come out on top, but took a shot and got it. I just installed it, so I can't speak to it's durability, but it feels solid and I suspect it will last. The instillation was a snap (they even include Teflon tape!) But you will need and adjustable pliers to get it tight enough so it doesn't leak, at least I did. The water flow and pressure are the best I have experienced from any low flow; strong, steady, even, and full. It swivels without leaking a drop. I have spent much more for very much less."
5,"Just what I needed to replace my old, worn out pump. Instructions were easy to understand. Got it hooked up and it works perfectly and quiet too!!"
4,what can I say - its a chain for a ceiling fan :-) it works.
5,Excellent smart water filter for GE refrigerator!
2,"I used this shower head for just over a month hoping to see a difference in my complexion and hair because the water at my apartment is pretty harsh. I saw no effects whatsoever during that month which was unfortunate. I was pretty impressed with the amount of pressure this head puts out. Though the pressure was good, it also created a sort of wind tunnel that caused my shower curtain to invade my bubble and fondle me while showering. Not pleasant. Certainly better suited for a shower or tub with a glass door. I just mentioned that the pressure was great but I must note that the pressure got increasingly strong as time passed. By the end of the month it was borderline painful which was ultimately the reason for swapping it out for something else."
5,Top!!!!!!
5,"They were fast on the order. It was very easy to set up, but had a little glitch getting all the components to sync with the base station. The techs were very efficient & helpful on the phone & fixed the glitch. Love feeling safer & monitored for much less than any other system."
4,"The opener seems to work fine, BUT getting it installed was a nightmare. The directions are horrible. It required lots of other parts that only an electrician could figure out. Ended up there was no way we could install it ourselves. By the time I bought everything needed and paid for someone to install it, the whole project cost $$1,500. Not what I had in mind when I bought it. Required so many modifications and changes that were leagues beyond any of our expertise."
2,"Order is delayed a month but now there is no option to cancel? That doesnt seem reasonable, given that this is a replacement for one of these that failed after 3 months. Price was low and 14 of 15 are still working."
5,"Just got mine in so I have only been able to give it a test run, but it appears to do the job. If you decide to use it to clean gutters you attach the stabilizer normally as you would for a vertical wall, then move the bottom (base) of the ladder out from the wall to form the angle."
5,"This Cosco chair has been part of my kitchen for 50 years - first as a child, and my mom still has hers. Then in my home for at least 20 years. And now I need another one - not because the old one failed but because I have another kitchen. The chair gives a good step stool, is good for at the countertop for writing, paying bills, and the kids love to sit on it doing homework. Am glad to see Cosco still makes it and Amazon carries it for a reasonable price."
5,I put this in our guest room which has the same coloring as the pictures. Turned out perfect! Good buy and got me out of re-paining our chocolate walls.
5,The purpose for which this motor was bought (replacement) has been completely fulfilled.
3,"The lights themselves are terrific. the self stick is horrible. They will test your patience, I INSTALLED THEM ON NEW CABINETS CLEANED WITH A THINNER WIPE AND SLOWLY BUT SURELY THEY ALL CAME BACK DOWN IN TWO DAYS. GRRR I THEN PUT LOCKTITE POWERGRAB ON THEM POOF DONE. THEY POWER SUPPLY ARE NOT THE BEST BUT FOR 20 BUCKS NICE."
5,Installed easily and actually appeared to be of a higher quality than the blower it replaced. Has been operating for two years with no issues so far. So no complaints from me.
3,"Arrived quickly and was well packaged. Very easy to put together- about 5 minutes each. Quite short in the seat area- on the verge of being uncomfortable. I wish that the seat was a little shorter (lower to the floor) and the back was a little higher, too. The base is quite light but feels sturdy when seated in it. I just hope that it holds up to use. Of course, I needed a small stool for my island so I guess that I got exactly what I needed."
3,"Definitely saves water, but is a little weak for my taste. Go 1.75 and you'll be happy. Plain and simple."
4,Its a decent electrical outlet and cheaper here than at Home Depot.
4,"Greenstar, who make this very good closer, also make one that's even better--it closes more smoothly: [[ASIN:B004ROJ1YG Touch'n Hold Smooth Single Kit - White]].<br />The closer on this page, like most of its kind, starts to close rather fast, and as you are stepping inside, may whack you on the Achilles tendon.<br /><br />Greenstar has a neat video that shows how their \\""smooth\\"" version reduces this problem: [...]<br /><br />I have bought both closers and can confirm that the \\""smooth\\"" version is much superior for this reason. It also includes the excellent step-on button to hold it open. Also available is a top-and-bottom pair which helps to ensure that the screen door closes more tightly at top and bottom: [[ASIN:B0058JLBEW Touch'n Hold Smooth Dual Kit Storm and Screen Door Closer]]"
1,Too messy. Not precise at all and forget doing ceilings.
5,"I bought this light to replace previous one in my bathroom that lasted for many years. This one is probably 50% larger and gives enough light to see, but is not bright enough to be annoying or disturb sleep. With the smaller light I had to use 2 when I had guests so that they could navigate, but this one is adequate on its own. I was unable to find this light retail, so I was happy to find it on Amazon."
5,"These drawer pulls are so nice and really did give a facelift of sorts to one very old white dresser. Just be careful when you're handling them, as there is a sharp piece in the back of each pull. Once they're in place there's no danger."
5,"I bought one of these about 5 years ago, and it worked like a charm. It finally died. I ordered a new one, and it didn't work. Got a replacement, and it didn't work AGAIN! Tried for a third, and it finally worked... Amazon was great with the return and replacement... but the Intermatic quality is REALLY iffy now. I was going to give up on it completely if the 3rd didn't work... I put it in today, and it's working - fingers are crossed. Bottomline - if you get one that works, it's an awesome switch. Easy to use, etc. But if you get one that doesn't work, good luck..."
5,"Installed this above a new shower. It was easy to install, looks great and gives a lot of light. This 4000K is typically 'cool' white, that is it doesn't have a yellowish tint. That's great for me because my shower was white subway tile and marble, so I didn't want the 'warm' color light. I probably will get another one for another shower."
5,This is great!!! I purchased 2 and I plug one in the basement &amp; one on the main floor. They worked great.
5,Perfect for a small under-cabinet space
5,Pull out the old broken one and snap in the new one. Perfect replacement.
5,"Get this system!<br />Easy to install. Works great right out of the box. I had no problems.<br /><br />I've relocated alot because of my job. In my last 7 homes, I've installed a system from a 'traditional' security company. Over $1000 in install (or more) and then then the commit to monitoring at $40 per month.<br /><br />On this house, I got the run-around so much from the 'largest local security firm' that I said &#34;enough is enough&#34; and tried Simplisafe. Awesome!<br /><br />Took me lass than 2 hours to install and test the system. Works great!<br /><br />I will never go back to the run around.<br /><br />Thanks!"
5,I love it. It is indeed space-saving product. The light is very good.
3,"I bought this as an Xmas gift for my mom last year. It's a little smaller than I expected, and you can barely see the light in it. But it's very pretty, and has lasted a year out in the weather with no problems."
5,Incredible!!! Gave us so much water pressure from not much more than of a light mist from our previous one
5,Absolutely love it. I ended putting this up in my wife's bathroom so that if/when she forgets to turn off her curling iron I could just go in (through our Z-Wave module) and turn it off. There has been numerous times we were well on our way to a vacation and sure enough the wife had forgotten to turn of here hot hair products. This device is wonderful and works perfect with our Vera light z-wave.<br /><br />Also the picture is when the unit is off. So when it's off there is a blue LED light when there is power to it there is no light.
5,exactly as advertised.
5,Works great. Adjustable.
4,"I'm not sure it's worth what I paid, but it does get the job done. The skinny PVC support pipes are only enough to be use exactly as intended. I put a 14&#34;-ish length piece of 3/4&#34; copper pipe underneath before filling to allow it to drain to the center shower drain. The valves seem pretty exclusive to the pump, and the pump is pretty cheap.<br /><br />I'm just so dratted grateful I can take a bath in my shower-only current living quarters."
5,The Pur replacement filters were the brand name and the cost was less than in stores. The faucet filter system is easy to install and the filters are easy to replace. The system flashes a green signal when filtering correctly and a red signal when it is time to replace. I would recommend this to anyone.
5,"All four bulbs have been burning every night, all night in window electric candles since December 22 with no problems. I hope to get that many hours again next year! Not too bright blue/white color."
5,Used it to attach two rugs together. Works great!
5,I am very pleased with all aspects of this item. I use it as a towel rack in the bathroom. I would buy it again.
4,"The bulbs are really good. A bright white that really brings out the colors in the room. These should be used for spot lighting a bit more as their angle is only 45 degrees of light. On the current dimmer, they dim fine but I only move the dimmer down about half way before they go off. Overall, a good value."
5,"I love that this light stays on in the dark and is not motion sensitive. It also doesn't shine up into your eyes, but where you will walk. I want to see where I am going BEFORE I get there!"
5,These have been around for some time and I've been using them for a long time. Still works fine
4,"This size was one that I couldn't find at the local Lowe's or HD, it was just what I needed for my space available."
4,great received on time.
2,It does the job; however you can get a metal one that looks better from you big box hardware stores like Homede-poo for less. Now I have to wait for this plastic crap to wear out. Then I will replace with metal ones.
1,"Based on an answer above, I was expecting this product to be 24 6' pieces. Instead I received a single 6' length. Unexpected given that it came directly from Amazon. Not worth gambling on."
5,All good
5,"Works better than any trap I have ever used. No mess, no fuss, no mice. What's else could you ask for?"
4,This is really cool!
5,"Hey, what can you say about a battery. Well it works, Most important it was reasonably priced and the seller was quick as a bunny...."
1,"Only works on max setting P.O.S. Perhaps we might all slow down and cogitate on our mad rush to consumer perfection. Perhaps adversity is the grindstone of happiness? Not so awful, eh? Toodle pip."
5,"A great deal!This Rain Showerhead is Awesome! It is so easy to install,I could do it myself. No tools are needed,you just take the old one off,put this one on and you are ready to go. This showerhead is Huge,it makes me feel like I am in a fancy hotel somewhere.The Shower Head is made with Stainless Steel so you know that it is going to last.I love standing under this,as it really does feel like you are in the rain."
5,"I love this item. It was a bit hard to install. The instructions are not all that clear. When you attach the disposer, to the bottom ring, there is a tendency to put it too high. It doesn't come with plumber's putty and it should. Apply a generous amount of putty when placing the top ring. (see you tube videos) The disposer runs great and is quiet and very efficient. It also has a removable splash guard and the competition does not."
5,"As advertised. Used for some tall garage cabinet doors that get used regularly and slammed thoughtlessly. They are well made and robust.<br />Note: Before installing them, I opened the service panel beneath the latch (access is provided by lossening a small phillips head screw) and added a drop of oil to silence a slight squeaking."
2,have to turn it off and on to use which is fine but I think it is more useful for a motel room door than an actual family home security item.
5,Easy to handle and fits in my trunk. Love it . Arrived quickly. It was great to use this for Christmas decorating.
5,"Lights work good, just as described"
1,Got a 4 pack a year ago and 2 died. The original incandescent bulbs lasted 7 yrs compared to theses which lasted just under a year. ROI on these do not break even. 4 bulbs saved me about 5 cents a month in electrical costs per the killawatt tool.
4,"I love love love the thermostat itself. I have a rental home an hour from our house that we rent a few days at a time. We use this to verify the temp and reset after guests leave.<br />That said. The setup can be abhorrent. I'm a 30-year IT industry executive so it's not 'above' me, it's just. Finicky. I've had to setup the same stat about 6 times in the past 2 years, after power outages and most recently a wifi access point change.<br />Sometimes it takes moments to set up. This time took me about 3 hours spread over 4 different days. The setup would finish and then error about the auth code being invalid which leaves you with no cloud access, just local.<br />So. Buy it and know once installed, you'll very thoroughly enjoy it."
5,All Kohler products are of the highest quality. This robe hook matches the finishes of the faucets and control valves in our newly renovated bathroom. Price is reasonable - quick delivery.
5,"nice looking, does need to be cleaned, leaves finger prints"
4,"To make my home safer for the kids, I needed light at certain areas at night, but some of the switches were placed in sub-optimal positions: too high for the kids, too far from the walking traffic etc. These motion sensor lights met my needs. I had a few requirements:<br />sufficient light to reduce possibility of tripping / walking into obstacle<br />remain switched on as long as activity was detected.<br />remains switched off during periods of sufficient illumination (i.e. day light)<br /><br />I bought 3 pairs of 2. So far I have tested 5.<br />4 of the 5 worked well, and met my requirements.<br />1 of the 5 did not work well. It switched on even in a bright environment, and even if there was no activity."
2,These switches are not good quality and over time do not work. Several of my switches do not click any more and I had to replace them!
5,Gives a lot of light for such tiny LEDs. Exactly what my daughter wants for her college apartment. Very happy with price compared to other offerrings in the marketplace. Highly recommend this product.
4,Bought this here didn't think I could find it anywhere then I saw it at Walmart. It is a great product and works perfect.
5,"This was a great replacement for the original (as the felt strip kept coming out of that one). The felt on this one protrudes a little less so presumably will stay in place far better. I've done a lot of laundry in the last 3 months since I purchased this and have seen no indication that the felt is going to pull loose, and it seems to be doing its lint-filtering job very well."
4,"Installed and worked as expected, dishwasher is draining much better."
5,"Great product, easy-to-use and set. Just adjust for your local son up and sundown times and it does the rest. Excellent product"
1,would not fit the pole. can only be used on a very very small & short pole.<br />Your courtisy was appreciated in handeling the return.
4,"works well but a bit over priced, as soon as I bough this found the same one near my house for half the price, it is built well and has been used many times"
1,"I wanted to use a drill pump and siphon to drain bathtubs for watering diruing our Georgia drought of 2008. On the first test, I got some water moving, so I assembled hoses and bought a cordless drill. On the second try, nothing. I tossed it. I am disappointed."
4,No issues. I have an Americam Standard unit that came with my house. For some reason they put Church seats on them. It was time to replace. White matches perfectly. Smooth feel. Easy installation.
5,"This was very easy to install, and the nice thing about it is the range of where you can point the lights. This is an under the eve (not wall) installation, and so far there have been no problems with it. The sockets adjust very easily. I didn't want to spend any more than I needed to. This turned out to be just fine. I think if I was looking for something to last well into the future I might have spent more, but who knows? This could last a long time as there is very little of anything that is subject to corrosion. Very happy with it."
5,"Because of &#34;alienlady's&#34; review and photos, I was worried about trying this spray. I'm glad I went with my gut. I bought the spray today, sprayed it on $3,900 worth of beadwork that had managed to get dull, forced myself to not panic over the cloudiness, and walked away for an hour. When I went back, the cloudiness had dissipated, and my beadwork was shiny and beautiful. This spray SAVED my project, and I will be able to deliver it to my client."
2,"Purchased this unit about 4 1/2 years ago. Very please with it until just recently. Stopped running in the heat pump mode. VERY hard to find anyone to work on it. Called GE and finally was able to make an appt with a service company. The repairman arrived, expecting us to already have the part for him. GE told us HE would be bringing the part. He spent over an hour and a half trying to figure out exactly what was wrong with it, all the while on the phone with either his company tech or GE tech. So, he eventually left and had us order the part from GE. Part arrived. Called to make another appt for service. Called the day of the appt (to find out if it would be morning or afternoon when the service guy would arrive)....and was told they had no record of appt. THEN they proceeded to tell us that we were to get the part from THEM....WHY had we ordered it from GE??? AUHHHH. Made ANOTHER appt for the next day. Service guy arrives, installs the parts that GE sent us (2 fans)...still wouldnt work. After an hour on the phone with GE, they decided that the &#34;board&#34; was the problem. Now that is ordered and we are waiting for it to arrive, then there will be ANOTHER service call appt. Have NO IDEA how much this is going to cost us. Yes, GE covers the part in the 10 yr warranty, but not the labor. THREE SERVICE CALLS!!!"
4,"We just remodeled the kitchen (Okay, we are in process... everything that was in the kitchen is now in the living room)<br /><br />The Delta Faucet we bought is fantastic, and this little gem matches the single dispenser that came with the Faucet. (Somebody explain why Delta doesn't put dispensers in for BOTH HOLES!<br /><br />Pumping action is everything you'd want it to be. It's quick to prime the pump, and it pumps quantity in accordance with your hand pressure.<br /><br />The bottle that holds the liquid has adequate room, but considering the difficulty involved in putting high quality dish soap and hand lotion into these bottles, they would have done well to have offered a tube that plugs into a large bottle on the floor under the sink. Short of that, it would be valuable to have received a funnel. The dispensers can be filled without removing the bottles. I don't recommend it if what you're adding is thick. It won't go in through the top. I removed the bottles and tried a funnel and was able to encourage my hand lotion to slide through the funnel neck into the bottle, by poking the dispenser &#34;straw&#34; through the funnel and into the bottle... many times. I'd not want to have to fill this very often. I made a mess, but now have very clean, very soft hands!<br /><br />I'll solve this problem of filling the bottles and get back to you! I think it may involve water."
5,"Required piece of equipment to run a manual air conditioner. Turns it completely off when not required, but back on again when needed!"
5,"This is the BEST system a person could ever get! I have so much control over where I place the sensors, how many I have, and what i think is important to protect. Plus NO WIRES! The only piece which needs an electrical outlet is the base station and I can decide where to place it. I ordered more display signs and extra sensors and love the fact I am not bound by a contract so I'm not wasting my money. This system is well worth the price for the peace of mind I get daily. I highly recommend this to everyone I talk to about do-it-yourself home security systems."
3,It doesn't sit perfectly flat on the floor and the actual toilet paper roll holder broke as soon as it came out of the package. Meh
5,"I used the tape for a trailer ramp to cover the bare aluminum. Now I don't have to worry about<br />calling 911 every time I walk up this ramp. Although pricey, it's the best tape available and it sticks<br />very well. I'm glad I bought it and would recommend it to anyone looking for good safety walk tape."
5,A+
4,"Ordered this fixture for a home office area and needed something that hung a little lower from a 9' ceiling. The brushed nickel finish matches the door hardware in the room and also the hardware on my office furniture. This gives a nice bright look and with the dimmer, I can soften the look if I wish."
5,"The product arrived earliy, as a hard-to-find replacement for an heirloom lamp, at a fair price, in a new, pristine conditon. What more can you ask for?"
5,"I'd recommend a plumber do this install because of the potential for things to leak (just my opinion).<br />I don't think it's a popular item by the way the my plumber looked at it, but he noticed the metal threads in the cap and gave me his approval. Along with a quality tank, it comes with 3 filters and a tool.<br />I'm pleased with the results...It's been about 1 month and the filter is starting to get murky, catching all the sediment, sand, & dirt that would be going into my plumbing and appliances.<br />It's a small investment, but it may pay off by giving my plumbing fixtures & appliances a longer life span by keeping the dirt out...not to mention a nice pre-filter for my drinking water filter setup.<br />I think it should be on every home's water main (just my opinion)..."
5,Good Product
5,Unit is quiet & puts out enough heat--installing it was easy enough & fairly painless....automatic in operation & simple--what else to say?
5,"Five stars for this outlet, works just as stated and really like the fact that you can get your furniture back against the wall without having cords in the way."
5,I use a wrist watch for my alarm clock and this alarm is about equal in volume which is good enough for me. It gives me peace of mind during storms that require back up power for my sump pump. I was looking for an alarm and the light was a welcomed bonus.
5,Nothng to be said except there is 100% improvement on the tap water I get via Brita! Excellent tool.
5,"I love this.<br />I cannot get my computer to recognize my iPhone 5 as a camera despite many hours researching and working with it. I was having to use my husband's computer and it was slow and unreliable (lost many videos)<br />This solves all those problems.<br />I can quickly pair my iPhone and Rav and load all my picture and videos to the sd card, then load them to my computer.<br />The only thing I don't like is that you don't get a thumbnail picture of the videos, just a generic icon.<br />I also like that I can load movies onto it to use as an external hard drive so that I don't take up valuable space on my phone.<br />I haven't used it as battery boost yet, but it's nice to know it's an option.<br />Great invention"
1,"I bought it and put it the guest bedroom. It has been used VERY minimally. One day it just wouldn't come on. My husband and I tried everything to no avail. It my opinion, it is not worth the money if it doesn't last longer than six months."
4,Does a great job. Wish they made a sink that was the same size but was wider than deeper.
3,Ok
1,basically it does not attach to the faucet...I don't understand why they put in the market such a bad product.
5,I like it
5,It is truly perfect. Glad I didn't have to change my locks. Multiple replacements make it even better. Good investment.
5,"love this! better than I expected, light weight and very versatile!"
2,Great LED replacement for 10W Halogen but they will not work with any dimmer circuits. Good warm white and very bright but they will not work with a dimmer because they contain their own AC-DC/DC-DC converter. You need to use G4 replacement that is 12V rated only for PWM dimmers to function.
1,"I bought 3 and put all 3 of them in a new fixture. One blew when the light was turned on. I notified Amazon and a replacement was sent immediately. Love Amazon for that. But the other original two blew out after about 1 month's use. (In a light would be on for maybe 3 hours or less per day.) The &#34;replacement&#34; one I got is the lone remaining one functioning in the light fixture, and has been for the past 4 months, and I just haven't bothered to replace the other two that blew out so quickly. I'm reluctant to buy again from this seller because of this. Maybe I got some from a bad lot - who knows."
4,My daughter will love these additions to her new flower beds!
5,This helped my laundry area gets oraganized. It fits small spaces but can carry number of laundry stuff. Great buy.
5,Perfect for a faux screen door for my patio entry
4,This light fixutes is well made.
5,Took this little dude out of the box and sprayed clear and then varnnish on 20 wood chairs in less than two hours. Best investment I've made in a long time! Lightweight and works like a champ!
4,Quick delivery from prime allowed us to miss only a couple of dishwasher cycles. Used for our Kitchen Aid dishwasher which is 2 years old exactly.<br /><br />Installation was very quick. Instructions used B&W photos that made it difficult to see whether the clips was upside down or right side up.Removing the old Adjuster was much more difficult than installing this. Came with a special screw that you attached to your screwdriver to finish off the unit.<br /><br />Putting the unit back was easy enough... we're taking it easy for now.
5,Bought this for my jetted tub faucet. Had to really work to get it on the faucet. I also put the plumbing metal ring that you can loosen and tighten with a screwdriver over the band area to help keep it in place. I am really pleased with how well it has been working. My tab faucet is about 2&#34; diameter.
5,"I have been using these trash compactor bags for several years and they always hold up to whatever I shove into them. I have a family of 3 and we empty our compactor once a week (we only have garbage pick up once every week). Trust me when I tell you it is jam packed by the end of the week, and I never have an issue with blowouts, these are some strong bags. No matter what brand compactor you have, it these are the right size (I have a 15&#34;), these are the bags you should be using. Cost effective too."
1,I need a pump that can fill about 90 gal a day for my irrigation system. The impeller fin broke jamming the pump and burning out the motor the first day. Would be nice if impeller was brass. Not sure if I had a defective impeller or this is typical. And no in case you were wondering there was no debris that got sucked up.
5,"I set this thing up and now I know when someone's trying to barge in to catch me during my precious me time. It makes loud beeps for each key press, which gives me ample time to strike a pose"
3,Not what i expected. the clock does not have a lock mechanism so not sure what the purpose of this is
5,"This is a great keypad for a good price. I would recommend this key pad for any Marantec owners, as it does not work with other brands"
3,Thought would be comparable to the 440i but was wrong. But overall decent machine get a lot of spray tails with 517 semigloss coats
5,"Excellent product - sticks extremely well in the shower, even with water constantly running over it. Though, I bought my second one as the first one finally gave in after 3 or 4 years. I would say that is pretty good longevity for such a product. Highly recommended if you are looking for something that will stick nearly anywhere."
2,You're still able to see through it so it didn't help much on my bathroom window. It looks much darker online.
5,"For $11 I cannot imagine this light being outshined (slight pun intended) by any other. Well made, light weight but solid - and a impressive light output."
4,Overall very good and easy DIY installation.
1,They constantly FALL off the walls!
5,"After four months, this product has worked very well and been very reliable. It needs to be positioned in a sunny area to work best. I used it out at 1,100 ft in partial shade and it worked 90% of the time. Moving it in to about 800 ft, in full sun, it never misses a car. It is good to always know when someone is driving up the driveway. Instructions might have been clearer, but were okay. I would recommend this to a friend, may give it as a gift to others or even buy more for myself to put one further away. I only rate things that are 1 star or 5 stars and this is one of the best products I've found and I don't have to change batteries every few months.<br /><br />Update: After 9 months, the product continues to work well and I'm going to buy another to help secure a portable storage building."
5,"Exactly what I ordered, looks nice, works good and is perfect for my arthritic fingers. Moen always stands behind their products and that was a big factor in my purchase."
5,"This stuff is amazing. it was very easy to use and it goes a long way, just this small quart can cover a lot."
5,This item worked perfectly. Exact fit.
5,"These are perfect straps for tying down cargo. I use two of them for each of my kayaks, which I transport in car roof racks and &#34;J bars.&#34; They do not have hooks or ratchets, just a simple locking buckle that holds securely, and releases only when you want it to.<br />This is the only type of tie-down I use, and this one is of very high quality. (I trust it to hold an $1,800 fishing kayak atop a car, traveling at 70 mph.)"
5,"My local big box stores only carry an R-2 rated insulation. This product is a bit thicker and rated R-4. Price, including shipping, is not much more than the lower quality stuff. I used an old bread knife to trim and shape it around various fittings/pipe straps, and it worked very nicely."
5,"Got these and all my mats for all my bathrooms and kitchen. SOLO is way better than any other floor heating thermostat I've used. Programs like an alarm clock, super easy to adjust the schedule and looks clean.<br /><br />I suggest buying from WarmYourFloor online, they offer the best service and support on Nuheat check them out."
5,"This is a great broiler for two portions. Whether steaks, chops, or chicken, you do not have to get out the gigantic broiler for a healthy dinner for two. Easy to clean. Substantial feel."
5,"This replaced the battery in my Craftsman opener, manual called for DieHard part 41B822 which is more expensive from Sears.<br /><br />Opener started an incredibly annoying beeping and the console said to replace the battery. I removed the battery to stop the beeping while the replacement was in transit. This has been working fine for a week. I will update the review if I have any problems with it later."
4,"I bought these as replacements for Redi Shades that had gotten old and slightly yellowed. I have three arched windows over rectangular windows in my garage, and they face the street. These are a perfect and very inexpensive solution to giving the windows a nice finished look.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the shade of white varies from shade to shade. I got one of them measured, trimmed and in place and when I put the second one up, it was definitely a different color. The first was a very blue-white, the second a more creamy white. Good thing I'd ordered an extra and was able to get three windows covered with the more bluish-white color."
5,"The lights are easy to install and put out a good amount of light. A lot brighter than the standard solar powered. Only problem I had, is on of the globes was broke. Wasn't too bad so I was able to glue it back together. The company that i got these through never responded to my vm about the broken globe. For the price and light output I highly recommend these. I also have 12 of the spotlights and they are really good, too."
5,Worked great. No idea why one didn't come with my house.
5,Product is amazing! Can't believe this has been out there and I have just started using it.
5,"toto is the best toilet on the market, period. ordering it through amazon was a breeze, too. it came in a couple of days; packaged securely and was in great shape. price was way better than buying it through a local bathroom fixture showroom. installs easily, works great."
5,Love it! Bought the whole suite and it looks so spa-like in my bathroom. One of my favorite purchases. Looks like jewelry for the bath. Arrived when promised and it was well packaged. Would purchase again or recommend to friends.
3,"These faucets are good quality and solid. I am keeping them because they were an excellent price. Not giving 5 stars because the design I picked is not what I received in the mail. Close enough, but irritating to pick out a pattern I liked only to be sent another one."
5,perfect
5,These timers were simple to setup and work perfectly. I used them over a holiday break to simulate someone being home and now I use them all the time to have the house lights on before I get home. It's nice walking into a nicely lit house.
5,Exact match at a great price and fast delivert
5,"We bought several of these to put into new, downward facing fixtures in our living room. These are perfect because we're not looking for any light other than down. There's no warm up period, they use very little energy and last forever. Love it!"
5,This is a very nice decorative lamp. It's heavier than I thought. Very good for the bedroom. It's actually on all the time ...
2,"First of all, it is a tall flush valve: the overflow tube adjusts from 8.5\\"" to 13\\"" and is by .5 \\"" taller than the OEM. I thought my Eljer Emblem toilet was standard height (it is 9.25\\"" tall to the front rim or the flush lever hole), but the valve barely fit, given that the fill valve's critical level should be higher by 1 inch than the top edge of the overflow tube. All the parts seem larger now a days, which does not mean better. A Plumb Craft fill valve I got adjusts from 9\\"" to 14\\"" but even when critical level line is just 1/4\\"" above the flush valve, the total height makes the lid not to fit. You may want to consider getting a pressure actuated fill valve (no float no rod) or measure your toilet carefully.<br /><br />The main idea behind this patented performance enhancing valve is the funneling effect created by a wider mouth, where the flapper sits and a narrower opening at the bottom of the valve. The flapper is really wide, so make sure you insert the bolts prior to attaching the flush valve or you may have problems with getting them through the holes.<br /><br />I could not position the flush valve perpendicularly to the tank walls, I rotated it a bit counterclockwise, because the flapper was brushing against the front wall. This would be OK, if it worked smoothly afterwards, but then the chain was catching the flapper, by hanging behind it and holding it up vertically in the air with water running forever, unless I wait and release the flush lever again. If I wanted to rotate the valve the other way, I'd have to disassemble everything and start over. So, I replaced the chain first, since it was really poor quality. This did not help, the smaller gauge chain still held the flapper up until I lowered the water fill level. If this water level proves sufficient, it will save us even more water, though the water saving claims are suspicious even after realizing that the valve leaves 1 inch of water at the bottom of the tank when drained (the seat disc is positioned higher than in the previous valve). So make sure to rotate the flapper clockwise towards the fill valve, not away from it. In my opinion instructions should include this advice.<br /><br />The tank to bowl gasket is very thick and it did not work for my Eljer (I was warned about it) - the tank wiggled so much with the bolts fully tightened, I had to get a more stable one (designed specifically for Eljer toilets, with bolts' gaskets and 4 tank rubber \\""feet\\"" incorporated), which included its own bolts. Also, there are just two tank to bowl bolts included even though the pictures on the package shows three. Not that I need them, but it is false advertizing. However, I liked the bolts from this kit better because they have larger heads and wing nuts rather than standard hexagonal nuts. Extra rubber washers proved helpful, too (why would I ever put metal washers or nuts directly against ceramics?).<br /><br />It flushes just fine now, we will see how it holds up in time. I did not buy it for performance improvement - my tank leaked at a tank to bowl bolt.<br /><br />The manufacturer's web site claims that this valve can improve performance OR reduce water usage. The flapper's cone has an internal rotating slot, which will reduce water usage the most when positioned in front and improve performance the most when turned all the way back.<br /><br />By the way, it took me a while to learn that a standard 2 inch flush valve's diameter is not an exact measurement and may actually be as large as 2 1/4 inch (the gasket fills in the space) and all the toilets built prior to 1994 complied with this standard.ed higher than in the previous valve). So make sure to rotate the flapper clockwise towards the fill valve, not away from it.

5,Great product and a great price.
4,I've had these for some time and still haven't changed the batteries. I ordered an extra set but haven't needed them yet. I think these candles look great. They flicker and the wax exterior coating looks very real.<br />Highly recommend.
5,"very nice, the product is match with my original type. and the product is new with no damaged. it function well with no problem so far, and the price is reasonable. shipping is also in time. it is good overall."
5,love it
5,"Easy, fast and unclogged the toilet that's been clogged for one week with numerous plunges."
5,Works great!! Love it!
5,"great ladder , us it for HVAC work in low country where units are on stands. So the multi position helps"
4,"There seems to be much confusion as to what this product is supposed to do. So I will start with what the manufacturer says it will not do and I did not expect it to.... It does not remove anything from your water. If you will have your water tested for hardness before and after, if there is any difference, it is not because of the Eddy Electronic Water Descaler. This product does not make your water feel any different or soap lather better.<br /><br />What it does do is prevent the minerals in your water from adhering to the inside of your plumbing, things like shower heads, faucet aerators, clothes washer, dishwasher, inside of your water heater, etc. The minerals are supposed to simply pass through the system and down the drain.<br /><br />SIX WEEKS ago I installed a new water heater to service my 5 bedroom, 2 1/2 bath home. At that time I also disassembled and cleaned the mineral crust from every shower head, faucet aerator, kitchen sink sprayer, etc. I installed the Eddy Electronic Water Descaler the same day the new water heater went in. The Eddy was installed in a location that protects everything in the house, hot and cold side. In the past, when I descaled all that I described above, within 4 weeks I was seeing evidence of scale build up again. (Note: I have city water that is reasonably good quality, but still some mineral content) After six weeks with the Eddy, I see nothing yet. I won't call this a definitive test until I get to 5 or 6 months out with the same result.... but so far so good. I'll update this review at six months.<br /><br />SIX MONTHS out now... I am starting to see a need to clean shower heads and the kitchen sink sprayer. So, I have come to the conclusion that under my conditions of city water, with light mineralization, two people using water here, the Eddy reduces the need to clean scale from faucets and sprayers from every 30 days to about 6 months. An additional benefit is that cleaning is easier than it was before... the scale that is there now is not as firmly attached.<br /><br />This is my last update on this product.is there now is not as firmly attached.<br /><br />This is my last update on this product."
5,"Great facet for the money, it is much better then the facet I replaced from Lowes at twice the price. This facet does have copper lines with the threaded adapters on the ends which make it nice because you can bend them alot to make up your connections."
3,"This will clean out most problems inside your house and will get some of your main drain clogs temporarily freed. But if you have something serious like roots in your drain, you need the professional grade (AKA Plumber).<br /><br />Also, don't waste your money on chemicals for any outside work. They only work for slow traps with hair and other dissolvables."
5,product work as it should. was shipped pretty quickly as well. I will more than likely buy a couple more just in case
5,"This Moen replacement wand worked perfectly. It looks great and cheaper than buying diverted parts or a wand directly from Moen. It looked different than the original old Salora wand, but fits fine and is a newer sleeker look."
5,I was unable to find these anywhere locally. The generic &#34;fits most&#34; of course didn't even come close to fitting. Bought 3 of these so should last me a couple of years.
5,"We have night lights in just about every room. We didn't need new night lights, just replacement bulbs. No one had them. They only had new LED bulbs which would mean we'd have to replace every night light with an LED night light. I saw this on Amazon & read the reviews & thought what the heck. They arrived very promptly, in excellent condition & they work perfectly."
5,"I water my house and my garden with a jet pump and pressure tank from our pond, so the water pressure switch gets a lot of use every day. Eventually, they all fail. All of the Square D switches give me at least 10 years of reliable service, so I'm glad to say something good about them."
5,Swapped out the old broken and popped in the new.!<br />Put a screwdriver against the Rail and gave it a bump with My palm and it snapped out of the notch same for the reinstall. If the ends snap off the other drawers I'm going to swap them side to side and reuse before buying new ones as it's only the ends break and both sides are mirror images of each other. Save some money and swap yours.
5,love these reveal bulbs so bright
5,"Have had a problem in winter with being out in the snow and your feet get damp even through the boots and socks, then inside in the heat and they get dry, and soon there are cracks in your heels. This product provides a seal to that moisture and healing to those cracking heels. Wonderful!"
5,"When the men came to deliver our new dishwasher and refrigerator I saw that they used lifting straps to carry the items into our house. I had never seen them before and was very impressed. Now that we have our own set in the house we are able to move furniture easier and more safely. The straps adjust to accommodate the item you need to lift. They fold up to a small size and can be easily stored for when they are needed. Trust me, when it comes time to move an appliance or piece of furniture, you will be glad that you have these straps!<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for sharing my honest and unbiased review. Opinion is entirely my own."
4,"A little wider and taller than the one we had in service that grew wheels and rolled away, still a very serviceable cart. Cannot fault the price, tho."
5,The Luxe Bidet Neo 110 is the answer for those who want a bidet but can't redesign their bathrooms.. I see it as the most hygenic way to answer these basic needs. I was able to install it myself but a plumber can make short work of it.. I was motivated to install it due to impending back surgery and it worked beautifully. On my recommendation my brother installed one before having similar surgery. I actually bought another one in case something went wrong with the original. Another reviewer recommended some spacers to compensate for the thickness of the Neo which is probably a good idea. My Kohler plastic seat is flexible enough to handle it. I am very happy with this product
5,Worked perfectly. Items was as described and fast shipping!
5,It's what I order. It's looks just like the picture and was warped nicely. It at arrived quick and I'm excited to put it up.
5,"I have this fan deck, but I actually bought it straight from Benjamin Moore for a lot cheaper!!!"
5,"I bought this to replace my old Rapid Fit bathtub drain plug and it works perfectly! I was glad it was so easy to install, too. The top had already come off my old one, so I just used ordinary pliers to twist out the old brass spindle. Then I just followed the instructions that came with this new plug to install it -- took less than two minutes. If your existing plug still has the top on you should be able to just hand-twist off the chrome knob, then remove the nut that's underneath the knob to separate the top from the spindle, then twist the spindle out with your pliers. It's a well-built, high-quality item, and I'm glad I found it!"
5,good qualty
4,I use these in both showers. They are tough to get in and out but I like the idea of having a filter
5,"Heavy, Solid, Good Quality pulls. I painted my old ugly cabinets and splurged on these to dress them up. Totally worth the price, these pulls cost almost double at the stores."
5,"I was impressed with the quality , price and speedy delivery. Highly recommend this product."
5,Genuine part for my kitchen aid dishwasher.
3,"This is a unique product in the US market, but it has a fatal flaw in the many geographic locations where tap water is soft: the carbonation level is much lower than in bottled seltzer. That means, for example, the water out of this system is pretty flat in most of New England and in NYC due to the low carbonate hardness in public water supplies. Otherwise a very trick system and probably great where carbonate hardness levels are high. Contact your local water authority before ordering to obtain carbonate hardness levels. Also might not be a bad idea to discuss with Grohe tech support before ordering, they are very helpful."
5,"These look and feel so much like real candles, but without the worry of knocking them over and starting a fire. When you have two big dogs in the house you just can't have a real flame going. These are the perfect solution to that problem."
2,this is so small
5,Unit was received in new condition with easy to follow installation instructions. 10 minutes start to finish and the new controller was installed and working. No problems to date and don't really expect any.
5,The valve assemble is exactly what I needed to finish my bath remodel.
5,"Love the brand, always will."
5,love it!
5,this was exactly what i wanted!
5,"Lots of good reviews here, so I won't repeat what others have said but to say that it installs very easy, the bowl fill tube is infinity adjustable for flow. Love the clicking mechanism for the screw ring on the bottom of the tank. And you can adjust the height of the fill valve very easily, as long as there is room to reach down the side of the fill valve."
5,Works great for preventing clogs in the non disposer half of my sink.
4,"If you need an airhose in sub-freezing weather, forget plastic ! This hose is strong, robust, withstands all the hazards of a construction site - and stays flexible. It's not as easy to keep clean as plastic, so is less suitable for indoor use."
5,"After locking myself out of the house while my 8 week old baby was inside, we decided it was time we put a key outside. My husband researched the different ones and we settled on this one. We are very pleased with it."
5,LOVE THESE...MY GRANDDAUGHTER LOVES THEM. BOUGHT THREE PACKS...STICK TO THE WALL.. PERFECT!!!!
5,"i owned these nite lights for many years and thought they were very good,,, yes.. i like them and would ordered them again"
5,the fact you can change to different modes makes this model one of the best!
5,So much cuter in person
5,"I read a lot of the reviews from other people on here about this. I did what they said about making sure the wires don't fall into the back of the oven. That was very helpful. I just needed an extra set of hands to hold the flashlight, but I did it by myself and it was quite simple."
5,"This worked pretty well, though it didn't last as long as my GE bulbs. Good when you're on a budget, but if you've got some wiggle room, you can do better."
5,Definitely a good price. Almost half the price compare to Sears or any other appliance store. I just can't remember how to reset to erase that warning light.
5,"Great connectors, true lifesavers if you have a led strip that has a failed led, or connector that takes the rest of the strip out."
5,"Really cool tool! Looks very professional, heavy duty, versatile, easy set up even for one person. The set of 4 is fairly heavy, maybe a fiberglass construction would help with that. I recommend it."
5,"This the best waste disposal unit ever made. Installation was fairly simple except for the mounting of the unit is a bit awkward without another person to hold it up. I used a car jack to hold it up while the locking ring is turned. The unit is so quiet it is easy to leave it on. When I first switched it on to demonstrate it to my wife, she couldn't believe it was running. It makes easy work of chicken bones and celery. The only thing that challenges it is onion skins but I assume no disposer canhandle these. Overall a great product at admittedly a high price but well worth it."
5,These work great and have everything you need to rekey a Kwikset lock to another key.
5,"won,t kink- very good"
5,My 8 year old son loves these. We actually got 1 set and then ordered another set to fill up his walls.
5,I love these sliders. I keep them under some of the heavy furniture all the time so I can move it periodically to clean. They sure save your back and are well worth the money.
4,Came quickly. Had a good price. Filters work well. I'm happy!
5,I'm ready for the next time I have to fix this part of my washer; all items as advertised and at a fraction of the cost from local vendors.
5,"I have a Moen shower valve, and the trim plate cracked and tore through the screw holes through which the shower valve was fastened. I bought a generic prelcement at Home Depot, that might have worked, but would have needed considerable modification. So I ordered this unit from Amazon, and it is a perfect replacement. It was quiet easy to install and took under half-an-hour to replace the part, which beats paying a plumber $150 to do the same."
4,WORK'S GOOD !!!!
5,Worked great and shipped promptly.
5,"Love this light, just wish the batteries lasted a little longer. I converted our old pantry with bi-fold doors to a walk in pantry and we needed light. Instead of tearing into the walls and running electrical (which I could do myself), I decided to give this a try. Works great! As soon as we open the door the light comes on and is more than enough light for the pantry. It works day or night without fail and turns off in a respectable amount of time. There are times it turns off before I would like it to, but then I just move and it turns back on right away. My only quibble is I wish the batteries lasted a little longer. I figured being LED they would last a little longer...but then again if it were a regular incandescent I'd probably be changing batteries weekly and the light output would be abysmal. For our need this is a 5 star product."
5,Two inch thick filters are not easy to find locally at a good price. This source has been VERY economical and the filters are well made. We haven't had to pay higher local prices in a long time. One more thing found to be more advantageous to buy online.
5,There are two types you can buy and I went for this one. Great tasting water. Plus the price was fantastic.
5,Right angle plug is good for tight spaces with little clearance. Just the right length to keep eccess wire to a minuimum.
2,"Works OK however the overall quality is dis-appointing for Krauss: The nozzle feels like cheap plastic. Flow is too restricted. Nozzle only snaps into the curved pipe at one position, about 45 deg. off of straight back. Looks odd and is annoying. The hose is too short to be useful if you install the weight. Would not recommend or buy again."
1,took it out of the box and only way it works is if you hold the wire a certain position at the box. Don't waste your money
2,"I put this in a kitchen ceiling can socket on 1-1-14 and finally took it out today, 11-28-14, after several months of it driving me crazy. It lights up fine when I first flip the light switch on, but this bulb (only this bulb out of all my kitchen lights) goes off after a few minutes. It's not burned out - if I flip the lights off and then back on again, it goes back on, briefly. I'll be contacting G7 soon to see what comes of their warranty - will update on that procedure/experience."
4,Plastic chrome ring in overflow is cheep and the chrome is peeling off. Other than that the sink is working fine.
4,"I gave it 4 stars only because the sprayer is difficult to grab without spraying yourself! This problem goes away once you train yourself to grab it a certain way. No leaks, like the new design with no rubber parts to fail and easy install."
5,Works as advertised
5,Just a little bit hot after relative long time using.
3,I GIVE THIS ITEM A THREE STAR ONLY BECAUSE THE SWITCH PLATE FOR THE LIGHT IS TWO SMALL HAVE FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT WORK
5,"I put three of these locks in thirty years ago and never had one problem, and they got used a great deal. I recently changed three entry doors and tried Schlage residential secure key and regular lever locks. I did not know this lock I installed 30 years ago was a light commercial lock, but I can sure tell now. These new Schlage lever locks are junk compared to my old A53PD TUL. The new lock when you open it with the key outside has to be relocked when you come in or with the key. The original lock had a button on the inside that stayed in even if you unlocked it on the outside, so you didn't have to lock it every time you came in. If you manually turned the button on the inside and let it pop out, then it would stay open one both sides but once you push it back, it stayed open on the inside but always locked on the outside. You can also tell the quality of both locks, and the residential feels like it could be ripped off with your hand but not the old lock."
5,Perfect - arrived intact and works great!
5,Love these. They dress up cabinets very nicely.
5,"My Freezer is working And I have Cold Beer now, Life is Good"
3,"I am so far disappointed in this system, primarily because the base station did not function whatsoever out of the box. When I tried to call for customer service on Sunday, I was dumped into the Horrid Hold Music Hell for 30 minutes before I gave up and pressed the &#34;leave a voice mail and we will call you back&#34; option. I left a message, and no one ever returned my call. I know it was Sunday, but if they are going to have their support line open, they should go to the trouble of staffing it properly."
2,light flickers and you have to tap the shade to keep one side light
5,Ordered this sink because it was made of a heavier type of stainless steel. Love it! It cleans up beautifully! We had it installed topmount because we like a more industrial-type look. It was a great choice!
5,"Used this to dye cement on a 3d aquarium background i made. Color was nice but despite being waterproofed and sealed it faded from light exposure over time. My fault for not using a uv blocking seal, which i would recommend if you want the color to stay rich. The product itself worked great and color was nice"
3,"I have ordered 2 remote controls, & neither of them would work with my strip lights. Must have a dead battery in the remote control. I have tried and tried to get help and for the device. I am going to ask for the help of Radio Shack and see if they are able to help me. I don't recommend this to a friend."
4,"This unit is almost so quiet you do not hear it. It is slightly slower than our old chain drive, but not obnoxiously slow. Homelink could not connect with my 04 Nissan, but does with our 06 Nissan. If you are set on using Homelink you should research it first. The wall buttons seem a little fragile."
5,I put these on my deck and they stay light until sunrise.
4,"Took a while to get it programmed correctly (maybe I'm dumb), but it has been working perfectly for weeks."
5,This plastic sheeting is awesome and it works extremely well. It is as advertised and I recommend this item<br />to all.
5,"When my wife had my 3 year old son out of town I purchased C3PO and an R2D2 decal from the same company to hang and surprise him. My son absolutely loves both of them. I've had them up for about 7 months and they are still up just as secure as when I hung them. I hung them on fairly heavily textured and painted walls. They stick better than I thought they would They were fairly easy to hang. You do have to be semi careful pulling them off the sheet, but I expected that. I like these so much I'll likely buy different characters from the same manufacture for my daughters room when she turns 3."
5,These work as advertised. I like that they are low lead instead of like what I was finding at the typical home improvement stores.
3,"Looks good, but our old air gap was old and it wasn't the greatest fit with the new one."
5,Clear instruction and easy to use.<br />We have it on our gate. Will update later if it withstand the weather.
5,"I HAVE BUYING LED BULBS ,FOR MY HOME .SLOWLY BECAUSE THIS LIGTHS ARE EXPENSIVE,AND SO FAR THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BULBS,,VERY BRIGHT, AN RUNS ON ONLY 6.5 WATS I RECOMEND THIS LIGHT BULB''"
4,"This is a very well-made seat. I looked for the solid plastic because I broke one of the painted fiber-board ones in only a couple of years, and I'm not that heavy, they are just that flimsy. Given the way this is constructed, I don't anticipate any problems. No, the seat won't stand up by itself (the cover does). If you don't want to hold up a toilet seat for a minute or two, perhaps you could just sit down.<br /><br />This isn't the most comfortable seat I've ever used, but maybe that isn't such a bad thing... I'll read someplace else instead."
5,"Great price, great product. The second one we have purchased within the month."
3,They do what they need to do but I'm not sure how long they will last. I'd probably buy again just based on price.
5,"I looked every where for one of these, it was awesome that I found this on Amazon. Made my day.."
5,Worked great for third of the price of original.
5,The Culligan FM-15RA L3 faucet mount system works great. It swings out of the way with no problems. The attachment was easy to install; no tools necessary and no adjustments needed. The original filter is still being used since August (it's October). Automatic shut-off works well (a fine feature). Setting a timer for two minutes prevents a running off and forget it mishap. Coffee still tastes terrific! The product is white - hard water makes things turn muddy brown over time. Planning to replace with another Culligan on occurance. Affordability and quality is very attractive.
2,They seemed a little bit cheapish in value.
5,"3 coats does it with this, drys quickly between coats, a light sanding and wipedown, then apply the next coat, Brush cleans up with water. Finished project looks very good."
4,"This is a clever solution and provides adequate light. It is cheaply made, so you will need to use it carefully."
4,"Installation was easy and I tested that it works properly. The lock is on the cheap side. One tip: make absolutely certain that you install it such that the teeth of the keys face up when you insert the key into the lock. Otherwise, the key may not be able to turn in the lock because gravity is going against the springs inside. At least, that was my experience. Once I installed it with the correct side up, I tested it to work a bunch of times with no problems.<br /><br />Edit: okay, now I realize the actual problem with the lock not turning. The instructions tell you to cut down the bolts that attach the lock to the door, but they don't tell you why. The reason is that when the cylinder on the lock turns, it also causes the steel cable to rotate. If the bolts are long enough, they block the cable from rotating, which blocks the cylinder from rotating. So it is important to cut them short or rig up some other solution to that problem. I used a Dremel cut off wheel."
5,"I have a border collie mix and german shepard mix, it used to take an hr each week to comb each dog in order to keep the shedding down. This dryer combine with the shedding tool knocked the time to less then half and it does a much better job. The pointed nozzle blow all the flakes and loose hair off with so much ease, its a real back saver! I highly, highly recommend this....."
5,Good.
5,"this is &#34;the&#34; camera for monitoring the entry to your home. I have tried many, but this one has everything (except speaker out). The facial recognition is pretty good. Now waiting for the associated TAG product to monitor opening of doors & windows (motion & vibration). I have used the weather stations for years and now another excellent product with the same excellent support."
5,Got this instead of the universal one at HD. Fits the Newport vanity top perfectly and looks great. Arrived in perfect condition.
5,"I was amazed that these were selling for such a low price. I had always thought bidets were expensive, but have always wanted one And then I saw this one and grabbed it, hooked it up, nice and easy, and I'm no plumber by any means. And now I'm happy. Simple to install, super cheap, works great. I've been using it for about 3 months now and couldn't be happier with it. It has plenty of pressure and does it's job perfectly. I've literally saved what it cost me in toilet paper in 3 months. I definitely would recommend this product!"
5,"good, no leaks so far"
3,This product performs as advertised except senses movement only about 10 feet from the unit. would have liked a bit more sensitivity but it is fine for the application.
5,These are great filters and I would highly suggest them. These seem to remove many of the impurities in the water. The change in smell alone shows that these work wonders!!!
5,Worked good in my monster power surge protect
5,"So far so good. I've been using it in the bathroom in a recessed lighting. Love the daylight brightness. Instant on. Not sure about the heat in the recessed can but so far no problems. Some reports of LED lighting interfering with wifi signals and even garage door openers but so far I have no problems. Very bright for 7 watts, enough for most users."
5,"We were looking for a center set, instead of a chandelier, in our dining area. This was perfect. We have single ones, in green glass over our kitchen island, and it matched those perfectly.<br />We actually used it without the base. We separated the pieces, installed them in a row, at same hight, illuminating to the length of our dining table."
5,"Works great. Took a duplex wall socket and turned it into six. Runs a light timer, sub woofer, iPod and iPhone with no problems."
3,This is exactly what they advertised but plumbing parts sure are expensive. Especially when you consider how much money these cost to make. This isn't the suppliers problem but the manufacturer is making a killing.
5,As advertised
5,Best of it's kind. The tea lights do exactly what they are advertised to do. Warm....nice color.....easy to use.<br />As a bonus I have given some to the smaller grandchildren (age 3-8) and they are fascinated! Thank you.....
5,Great product. Exactly as described.
5,These little magnets were smaller than we even expected but they are SHOCKINGLY strong! Two of these itty bitty magnets held a mascara firmly onto a metal wall mounted tray.
4,Right
5,Super good deal when it was on sale. greatly increased the pressure of my lackluster shower. big improvement over our previous $5 shower head from discount world.
2,The area where one would install this on the door must be flat or this cannot work without some modification. Mine were not.
5,"Stop thinking about it and just buy it!, I hate painting and this was actually fun well at least really quick, very easy to use, safety on trigger is simple and works, its really light but nice quality. I debated this and the X7, since they are assembled in the U.S. while the wagner are made in China, and decided to save the 100, and went with the X5, it is easy enough to grab the bucket and the spray pump in one hand and hold the spray gun in the other to move around, so for me the lack of the cart with this model is no problem. I sprayed 18 gallons (10 primer and 8 paint) in about 4 hours and had not one glitch or problem at all, cleaning is not bad. I also used the 30&#34; extension and could reach 10 ft ceilings without a ladder, really nice."
5,Excelent product. I will use it to paint an entire parking lot. I recommend this paint sprayer and actually I'm thinking to buy all the accesories
5,"Very modern, sturdy and goes perfectly with my modern bath"
5,Excellent.
4,Nice product. It wasn't as bright as I expected but it's good enough for my little girl's closet. She likes it too.
5,"Solidly built, heavy, and weather-resistant are apt descriptors for this Stanley padlock. It certainly gives the impression of being well-constructed and strong. I bought it for an outdoor hasp.<br /><br />By the way, it's important to be sure the hasp is as strong as the lock. This should be pretty obvious, but I learned the lesson the hard way. I lost two inadequate hasps that a thief cut off around the lock shackles, thus defeating the locks without even touching them. The locks themselves were left on the ground undamaged."
2,"I usually get the white &#34;Filtrate&#34; ones, but was short on money so I thought I'd give these a try. Not impressed. Dust goes right through and it bearly catches anything. I would return if I could but I already used a few from the box. Wouldn't recommend."
3,"Great product for the money, the only disappointment is that you cannot run the shower and the jets at the same time. Other than that it looks great."
5,"A well built gadget ladder that works in a variety of situations like unlevel surfaces or stairwells. It is the best ladder I've ever owned. Here's a couple of bits of information that might be helpful: 1. When fully extended, the highest rung/step rated safe to stand on is 69 inches above the level ground surface. It is the second rung from the top. So, this 8-foot ladder offers a maximum safe standing height of 5 feet 9 inches. 2. The next step up - or the first rung from the top - is labled with \\""Danger\\"" and \\""Warning\\"" stickers. \\""This is not a step.\\"" Well, it is built just like the other rungs and is solid. Therefore, it is a step, if you have uncanny balance and want it to be a step. It is 80 inches above level surface, but I wouldn't want to stand on it without something sturdy to hold on to. Another thing that makes life easier with this ladder is a good quality silicone spray like CRC Heavy Duty or NAPA. Don't use the foaming junk! Silicone does not collect dirt and dust like WD40. It is a clean lubricant. Spray the sliding boom, latches and hooks as well as the slide locks on top. After playing with the ladder right out of the box for a few minutes, I sprayed it with silicone. What a difference. It adjusts and glides into position smoothly. 34 pounds is not an issue. Move on up to the next level, which, for a change, is one you can actually see and touch."
5,can't wait to put this on my wall. They are going to be around a mirror in my living room. they are just want I expected
2,This faucet would work fine had I not been installing it on a granite surface. The granite surface is thicker than this faucet can handle.
5,A great product. I've had one just like it for about 15 years and it still produces. Bought this one for a grandson!
3,"Not seller's fault. This thing is big. It doesn't need to take up so much real estate. Positive note, if your device requires dedicated outlet, this is one way to get it."
5,Everything was like I expected it.<br />All good.
5,1. Small<br />2. Bright<br />3. Good Color<br />4. Does Not Get Hot At All.<br />5. Best Price So Far Per Bulb.
2,"They are not bright. I bought them for Christmas eve mass in my church, and was very dissatisfied with them. They were white, and were not amber as pictured. Save your money!"
5,"Like the color, and the s-biners are a little more decorative for things like hanging my keys on the outside of my handbag. Nicer than a regular carabiner. I'll get more, if I need them."
4,Does the job. Worked well for my radon vent sidewall.
5,I like to decorate my kitchen in the fall and was pleased to find this pumpkin spoon holder. It's just as pretty as pictured and I look forward to setting it out when autumn comes around.
5,Replaced the old builders quality shower head. This head is awesome once you remove the water restriction washer. Now its awesome!
5,Really like this product and it perfectly fits the lighting need we had for our son who does like venturing in the dark in the hallway.<br />We could fit it instantly and up and working so far and lights up with the slightest movement in the dark.
1,"When I received this product, it did not have a nozzle on it,rendering it useless. I would like a replacement."
4,"Just what was ordered. Way too many for one application, but they have a good shelf life."
5,I had it for 6 mmonths now still works and looks cool. Looks impressive and fansy . Worth the price. I Recomend it.
5,"After spending an inordinate amount of time howling at the moon, my wolfen brothers and I ran through the arctic forests of Johanngeorgenstadt, Germany hot on the trail of the No-armed man. I could still hear that tragic, heart-wrenching melody of Do The Limbo Dance from the [[ASIN:B0000070S1 Looking For-Best of David Hasselhoff]] concert where I had tracked the No-armed man and been ambushed by a lead pipe to the back of the head. Only now the shoe was on the other foot, and the three wolves and I chased after the No-armed man with the help of their keen sense of smell and the radioactive tin of [[ASIN:B000796XXM Uranium Ore]] I had been mashing against the side of my head for warmth.<br /><br />Finally, after thirty years, I saw the image I had burned into my retinas, the No-armed man running ahead of me, almost within my grasp. My wolfen brothers stopped me, knowing I would catch the No-armed man now, and said their farewells. This was not their war, as much as they may have wanted it to be, and knew that I must go on alone now. We laughed, we cried, we remembered many stories that we had shared, and then we parted ways.<br /><br />I ran after the No-armed man and quickly caught up to him at the edge of an enormous cliff. To one side of him flowed a massive river that dwarfed the Amazon, to the other side of him rose a sheer cliff, and behind him, a drop of nearly one mile to the placid surface of the lake below. And yet his deadliest choice was infront of him, me. It was then that I heard his voice for the first time and his words shocked me to my core.<br /><br />\\""I didn't murder, John W. Trimmer, the author of [[ASIN:0870334336 How to Avoid Huge Ships]],\\"" he said. \\""And he's alive with your ex-wife.\\"""
5,Amazing. My dishwasher was totally funky and it now smells great.
3,"It does a part of the job in the dryer but would really need more flexibility to get the dryer truly lint free. What is does well is get the dirt, dust and dog hair from the refrigerator bottom area (where the little vent thingies are on the bottom). It is just that I was hoping better or the dryer but I guess I will have to keep looking for something that will dig everything out in there. Right now I can live with a 60 percent solution for the dryer and a a 90 percent solution for the frig (hey I am not sure what I may have missed under there)."
1,does not fit - dimension is wrong
1,Don't bother buying! 2 of the 12 cues quit working on the 2 time operating.
5,"I have been looking for this item for years! Could not find anywhere - local hardware stores, not even Home Depot where I bought my kitchen 10 years ago could help me. So happy to find these - before them I had two shelves in my kitchen that I just couldn't use because I was missing so many pegs and I refused to redrill new holes to fit the larger ones that I could find. I hope you continue to carry these!"
2,"Construction:<br />1. The fan shroud is flat with only one formed rib. This allows the shroud to contort once mounted causing the fan to hit the HEX head (should have been round-head) mounting bolts. Additionally, it is designed to be put into a PRE-CUT CIRCULAR HOLE of the exact size to give the shroud needed stability and prevent distortion to the shroud. *Plywood NOT INCLUDED.<br /><br />2. The available mounting slots in the shroud are limited to two choices which, AGAIN, limit you to a PRE-CUT CIRCULAR HOLE in a sheet of plywood for mounting.<br /><br />3. The electrical box is slightly undersized with no shielding for the 'hot' terminals going into the thermostat. An unshielded standard Romex ground can easily come into contact with either of the hot terminals if you're not EXTREMELY careful when putting the cover back on.<br /><br />4. There is no vibration padding/dampening anywhere at any of the mechanical connections.<br /><br />5. NOT BALANCED!!! The fan blade unit was either not balanced or the hub was not perfectly centered. It is vibrating and loud in the house.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />I WOULD NOT recommend this fan.<br /><br /> This was a replacement fan for me. Because it was so flimsy and would not fit a straight top and bottom frame support, I disassembled it from its shroud housing and put it into my old shroud. Once in the sturdy shroud from my old unit, the fan had the balance issues; balance has to do with blades and would not change in a different shroud. We'll see how long it lasts."
5,This is the exact match for my A/C unit. It fits and filters perfectly. I'm not exactly sure what else to say about an A/C filter. Thanks.
5,This safe is simple and easy to get into fast with the push button combo. Very Nice for the price!
5,"Great light for the money, VERY bright and has a nice quality feel."
1,I didn't realize these were plastic and not the strong metal I expected. Guess I need to read better next time.
5,This is perfect for my patio.<br />I had a tough install. I had to tunnel up under the concrete for a retrofit.<br />This drain did a great job and was one of the easiest parts of the job.<br />I attached the exit port of this drain to a 25' french drain pipe. So far it has taken all the water that I give it. I may go back and lengthen the drain pipe length just because I like to overdo stuff.
5,"Yes, this is just a piece of small diameter rope with plastic devices molded on to the ends. But, it is an easy repair, and works much better than any repair you might try to make on your broken cable. There is one on each side of your dishwasher, so buy two and avoid the hassle of removing your dishwasher twice."
3,Plastic. But so is original equipment. Don't expect to last long but at least I was able to find replacements.
4,Could cover a little better. Raw wood two coats.
1,This is the second valve I have bought in 5 years! Both times the ice maker valve solenoid opened up. I have since put a protective device (varistor) across the coil. This is not like I am buying some over the counter replacement because it is a direct replacement and recommended by the manufacturer. If you find this product on sale you better buy several because you'll need them!
5,An extremely unique and beautiful design. Went perfect in our newly remolded kitchen. Would order these again. Order a few extra light bulbs since they are difficult to fine locally.
3,Product was fine but it was a single filter and NOT a 3 pack as advertised. Pretty disappointed.
5,"I love these things. Theyre nice and small, but secure and of good quality. Only 3 dials makes combos easy to remem"
2,Tried it and it didn't mold properly to the base of a round tub or to the base of a straight shower stall. Not recommended.
5,"It's attractive, solid, and US made. It uses about the same amount of water as the previous low flow head it replaced, but the output feels a lot stronger and more like a shower should. I'll be buying another for the other bathroom. Have had it in place for around 2 months and no reduction in performance. The previous version I'd used would have lost 20+ percent effectiveness by now, and the spray would have become irregular. Highly recommended."
3,"Installed in minutes and works fine. It is quite a bit smaller than your average sized hand shower, but larger than a typical kitchen sink sprayer. The included hose is only 4 feet long, which is a bit too short for my application. Luckily, a friend had an extra 5 foot Grohe hose that makes it much easier for me to get a good upwards spray where needed. The spray pattern is narrower than I would have liked (about a 1 inch diameter stream), but it does the job. Water only flows when the lever is pressed, so this unit is probably not a good choice for a single head setup. I have this item paired with fixed showerhead (Delta Faucet 75152 Water Amplifying Adjustable Showerhead with H2OKINETIC Technology)."
5,My fourth bidet and delivers excellent comfort lol !! VERY RELIABLE AND EXCELLENT QUALITY
4,looks good and easy to replace
4,"I had this model Rinnai installed in February 2013, so I've been using it for 5 months now.<br /><br />Usage:<br />Usage is *almost* like when I had a tank water heater. There have been some minor annoyances. The biggest annoyance, and most reproducible, is when I shave. When I shave, I turn the hot water on, run the razor underneath, and turn it off again. Shave a section, water on, rinse razor, water off. Repeat. Eventually, the Rinnai decides that I'm not using any hot water and does not heat the water. Every single time I shave, I have to deal with eventually getting cold water from the tap when I ask for hot. I have called Rinnai tech support and they were unable to help with the issue. If not for this issue, I would give this model 5 stars.<br /><br />I think the culprit is a problem with their flow rate algorithm - I am actually using enough gpm (gallons/minute) to keep the heater on, if you average out my usage while shaving over a whole minute. However, during smaller windows of that minute I use 0 gpm and so the Rinnai's computer shuts off the heater. Rinnai, please fix this and you'll be rockstars.<br /><br />There is a smidgen of longer latency when you turn on the hot tap until when you get hot water, but it's hardly noticeable.<br /><br />Energy Usage:<br />During these periods I lived in a 2 person household with 4 bedrooms, and I switched from a large tank heater to a large tankless heater (this one). My natural gas usage during spring and summer months (not using the air heater) has dropped, on average, in half - from 12 therms/mo to 6 therms/mo. This only saves me about $6/mo, but I'm happy to reduce my environmental impact. I also have a gas stovetop and dryer, so my gas usage isn't all for hot water.<br /><br />I also measured the electricity used by this Rinnai - it uses about 0 watts when idle (as it should) and 30 watts when running. 30 watts is slightly more than I expected, but it at least does not run very often.<br /><br />Installation:<br/>You should know that this is not going to be a simple job to replace a traditional tank water heater due to these complications:<br /><br />* The RU98IN uses a dual venting system which combines intake and outtake in a special pipe. IIRC, the exhaust pipe is inside of the intake pipe in concentric circles. It may be a pain or impossible to run an additional vent, e.g. to the roof. In my case, it is mounted on the external wall so it vents through the wall outside.<br /><br />* The RU98 requires a 3/4\\"" gas line, and your tank water heater may have used a smaller line.<br /><br />* This RU98IN also has a condensate drain, and so you must locate the water heater near a drain. Warning: the condensate is somewhat acidic so if you have older iron drainpipes you may want to not install this system. On the plus side to the condensate drain, the condensate itself is a by-product of this unit efficiently burning natural gas - so there is a good reason for it.<br /><br />* The RU98 also requires an electrical outlet to be nearby. If you don't have one there already, you'd need one installed.<br /><br />Maintenance:<br />About once a year you should clean and flush the system to prevent scaling (flushing might only be in hard-water environments?).<br /><br />Update: I completed a maintenance cycle a year after installation. It was fairly easy and I used these Amazon products:<br />[[ASIN:B002NJ99PS PETRA X1109-8FF-TP Black Rubber Washing Machine Hose, 8 Foot]]<br />[[ASIN:B000X05G1A Superior Pump 91250 1/4 HP Thermoplastic Submersible Utility Pump]] (The pump works great, though it is higher velocity than is required)"
4,"I got the WaterPik JP-130 to replace a shower head that was set too low for my husband. Installation was easy enough, though, we had to purchase plumber's white tape to get a good seal. Other showerheads I've purchased have come with the tape included which is why I took off one star. The arm was long enough that my husband can step under it and still have clearance from the wall. It creates a soft fall of water that I really enjoy and the head is large enough that I am actually able to wash my hair more quickly as it hits more of my hair at one tim. I've not had any problems with the thumb screws and I have been move the unit quite often so that I can shave my legs. I've loved this product so far and would definitely purchase again."
4,It was a perfect fit
5,I am a fused glass artist working with thick plate glass. This tool is the only way to snap thick glass. This is a expensive tool and it is worth every penny. If you work with thick glass this is a must have tool. One other suggestion is to purchase a cutter designed for thick glass. Your best result will come by using the two together.
4,Verry nice but small
3,"The picture and color description is much lighter than the actual item. The actual color is somewhere between off-white and light brown-khaki. This might be useful for any of you planning to match this with something else in the room (ie., trim and socket covers)."
5,Bought these grates to replace some old thin metal ones. They are beautiful. They fit nicely and add a touch of detail where the old ones look cheap. The bottom frame is hard plastic but hasn't posed a problem. The only issue I have with this design is that they don't make a matching furnace intake large enough for my wall intake which will be weird having mis-match designs in the same room.
3,"Make of paper, not very thick, and not block enought light. The price should be cheaper b/c the product is just paper."
5,Bright white beautiful little lights.
5,"You get what you pay for. At under $30 this is a great showerhead for a great price. I purchased it during a bathroom renovation for my guest bath. It has received nothing but praise from those that have used it. Was very easy to install. Yes, there are plastic pieces, but go ahead and hand tighten them, they won't break or leak if you give it a good, tight turn. It is a durable product. I have no leaks whatsoever. Good water flow on any setting. And it looks sharp with a modern, sleek design. UPDATE - sad to say one year later I had to replace this shower head because if starting leaking water from the plastic connection connecting the head to the tube. I took it apart, cleaned it well, reassembled tightly and still kept leaking. So, my first line above \\""You get what you pay for\\"" is definitely applicable here."
1,"DO NOT BUY A BAGSTER!!!!! The product itself seems to be fine. The customer service is probably the worst that I have ever seen. The day of my bagster pickup I came home to find it sill sitting in my driveway with no note attached, no phone call, nothing. I called customer service to find out the problem, and they had no information to give me but assured me that they would call me back and get it resolved. Next day no phone call and no pickup. Called back and got yes sir we will get it rescheduled and picked up ASAP. Three days pass and no call, etc. I call them back after noticing a $50 fee on my credit card from them. After speaking to a rep I asked to be transfer to a manger but was transfer to scheduling. Finally she transfers me to a manager. Then she tells me all sorts of BS about not being able to access the bagster in my driveway (BTW - my drive is 35 feet long and 11 feet wide with plenty of space to get in and out. Then they said it was obstructed by a Ford Explorer (There was no car in my driveway at the time plus I don't own Explorer and live alone). My question was why didn't the driver a) call me b) leave a note. Of course these questions cannot be answered. After asking for a refund for my $50 I get answer that she will forward it to her Ops Manager who will then decide if I get my money back. Of course I will never see this money again.<br />DO YOURSELF A FAVOR - if you can, pile the debris somewhere on your property cover it with a tarp and call a LOCAL junk/debris removal company. You will save at least $70, a giant headache, and can sleep well knowing that you are supporting a local business instead wasting your money with Waste Management."
1,So glad you asked.!!! This rack was ordered to be a certain size. It is too large and does not fit in my dishwasher. I tried to return it and the company refused. It was during the Christmas Holiday and was a terrible experience. I still have it and it cost a lot of money. Amazon should do something about the company's service.
1,"Didn't work at all. The minute I got the water to come out of the hose you could see it inching off of the spigot. It needs a clamp to hold it on, but I don't have the time to find one so I returned it."
5,"The handshower that that came with our Hansgrohe tub set was just awful. It dripped and dripped. Despite numerous call to Hansgrohe, the store I bought it from and the rep, they all denied the standard handshower ever dripped. So I threw it away and replaced it with this model. One drip as opposed to a puddle. Very nice and compact too. Perfect for deck mounting."
5,"These Legend handles were a great buy! They are attractive, sturdy and inexpensive when compared to their competition from the home improvement stores. This variation is the one you would use for a door you wish to have the option to lock, like a bathroom or bedroom door. There is a turn knob on one side of the levers. Included with each box is a two sided lever, a striker and a tumbler mechanism along with the required screws. We replaced ALL (21) of the doors knobs in our house with these types, some locking, some key-locked and some standard levers; they all look, feel and operate great. Installation was simple, too. The price of these levers was about two thirds that (64% to be exact) of the home improvement store. I handled (pun intended) the brand at the home improvement store and it felt to be of similar quality to these Legend levers. Overall, these were a great buy and they add a subtle elegance to our home versus our old builder-installed brass knobs.<br /><br />UPDATE 7/2017: These levers continue to look and function great! After almost three years installed, I have no real complaints. If I had to point to a few very minor nitpicks it would be that the outside levers (exposed to the elements) have had a bit of their finish wear off; I kind of give that a pass though. Also, some of the springs in the frequently used levers have weakened a bit and the lever hangs slightly below a perfect 90 degree angle...however for non OCDers that shouldn't be an issue. I still definitely recommend them."
4,I've been using these light a long time now and do like them BUT they don't last very long. They claim 500 hours which means only 1 to 2 months of outdoor useage.
5,"I broke my first one after more than 6 months of (drunken) abuse, and a few weeks later my mom saw one and got it for me before i could find another. pluss you get mad pprops for owning this thing."
5,"Geniune whirpool part, worked great."
4,they work. easy to install.
5,"I messed up on my order at no fault of theirs, they were super helpful fixing my problem. Love them, fast shipping and they are just adorable"
5,Works exactly as it's supposed to! I have these placed under a large leather sectional sofa that sits on a slippery tile floor. I also have a 50 lb Boxer monster puppy that loves to launch onto the sofa at high speed and try to destroy my house by constantly rearranging furniture. These have been a LIFESAVER!
5,"WORKS GREAT, EVEN OVER A LONG DISTANCE."
5,"I was worried these would be cheap because they're plastic, but mine came in in very good condition and haven't broken thus far! They are pretty bright too - not so bright it's annoying, but they do light up my driveway! Would recommend, you can't beat the price and they look GREAT!"
4,"seems to be working well, keeping the water cool enough for the dog not to loose interest in drinking it"
5,"great flash light very well made, very bright and the size is perfect all in all its a very effective light"
3,I ordered 3 of these. One is awesome. One does not work. I replaced the bulb bur it did not fix the issue. The 3rd had wept in the packaging and salt stains and residue had to be cleaned up.
5,"I knew that I was going to move twice this year so I decided, after years of pondering, to purchase a dolly. I figured that they would be expensive but I was surprised when I found this one. I read some of the user reviews and the price I bought it at was a no brainer. If the previous reviews were wrong, then I wasn't out much money. Anyways, I have to say that this little guy is just right for light moves around the house. I would not recommend this for heavy use as I think it might not hold up. However, if you are moving, or move stuff around the garage or house and your back just isn't up for it anymore (like mine) then get this. If you're feeling like you might want something more then get a cart with inflated tires. But for home use this is more than adequate."
5,Excellent shower enclosure!. Sturdy construction with solid hand bar. Easy to install with adjustable feet. Very pleased.
5,It was the part we needed to get our central heater working again and just in time before the winter
4,These seem to work fine. Time will tell if they last longer than the other ones we used.
5,Wish I had found it years sooner!! Is great to use a d easy to move. Terrific with new electric lawn mower!!
4,"Not much to say about this, its a good size and well made. It does the job of filtering food and debris from going down the plug hole."
5,"Water tastes good, great filters, and great value! Its even real easy to install. You get a greater deal if you opt for a bigger pack of filters."
5,"If you are short on patience or arms, you might want to choose the paddle-blades instead of the tropical blades. It comes with both sets. The tropical blades make it difficult to wire up, because they are wide, and you have to reach around them and really extend yourself to get everything wired correctly. It can be done though - my husband ended up reaching around it with one of the blades mashed against his face to wire it. It wasn't very comfortable, but it can be done.<br /><br />Installation at first went along amazingly simple, at the end of step 4 to step 5, I realized the directions in section 5 were for NO LIGHTS, and I needed lights, so make sure to pay attention there, as the book didn't seem all that clear to my husband, and he ended up having to redo the fan so we had a light.<br /><br />On 6.3 in the directions, it shows 2 wires just exposed hanging, and it doesn't tell you what to do with them. We put caps on each one. It would be nice if the instructions were more clear there. In any event, that did the trick and it worked.<br /><br />It came balanced and it is PERFECT. We didn't have to use a balancing kit at all. It works really well, it puts out a lot of wind - I could feel it across our kitchen/dining area, and our old fan could never be felt that far away.<br /><br />The hanger bracket and the hanger ball make it really easy to put into place while you do the wiring. In the past, we had ceiling fans where it took 2 people, but with this, you put the bracket up, and set the fan in it, and it holds it fine until it is wired up. We had a bit of a business interruption, so work on the fan had to be stopped for a day, but it hung in place until the next day when we could finish it.<br /><br />Don't be intimidated by the electronic receiver. My husband commented that it looked like an octopus with the wires coming out of it, but they are color coded and easy to match.<br /><br />We only have 8' ceilings, so we didn't extend it down, but it's fine for clearance when mounted 'short' for us. For inside use, you don't have to stuff the wires in this little box- so there's a bit more care that needs to be taken with the wires for outdoor use.<br /><br />For right now, I put it in my kitchen, and I love the color- it's a rich chestnut brown. I did have a white fan there, but the blades constantly showed any dirt, this one won't do that. Also it is a lot brighter than the one I had - the old one only had 2 lights, this one has 3. It comes with 3 compact florescent bulbs too, which was a nice bonus.<br /><br />The remote works well - it runs on a 9 volt battery that is included. It comes with a holder that mounts to the wall. They included a bit of extra hardware in case anything got dropped.<br /><br />It's a very solid attractive fan, and there's no wobbles at all, and it really moves the air. It's easy to see the quality of it by just looking at it. It's very well made..

5,"I have Payne 376B 24040 furnace, wich, according to my long research calls for motor HC39SB115 (newer part number), which is only available from few retailers and ranges from $350 to $790(!) in price. There is no way I wpuld pay that, to I took a bit of a risc of getting this generic unit. All parameters seemed to match, the only grey area was sizing. There was no info on its diameter, which was critical to fit into existing mount.<br /><br />I'm happy to say it worked out great and fit existing mount perfectly. Wiring was very easy (reused stock plug harness) and it works great and quite."
4,"What's to say, right color, sturdy, does the job."
5,Very good.
5,"This product exceeded my expectations. I have 2 restrooms and utilize this in my guest restroom. It was easy to install and I did not need to purchase any spacers. It fit perfectly. The self-cleaning feature makes this item worth the price. If you are looking for a good bidet at a good price, I'd recommend this one!"
4,Neat...but not very bright. I may need a new battery--though I just got it today. Nice size...comes in a little envelope-style container.
3,Great item saved me money doing it myself ..
4,This is my third installation of the Samsung water filter. It installs quickly and easily and lasts 6 months. I would have given it 5 out of 5 stars but the price is high and has gone up about 18% in the last year. It may be worth buying the multipack for that reason.
5,Perfect!
5,Excellent solution for the door that used to blow shut when the windows are opened and blow closed when a breeze comes up. Very satisfied with the quality. Time to get two more!
4,Product as advertised. Seems to be a good product with a little high price. Purchased because did not want to search all local hardware stores and Walmart stuff is usually of low quality. Used to repair rotting fence posts.
5,Thank you very much all working well
5,Excellent
4,"Great light, easy to install. only issue with it is that the globe moves around a little. Had to spend some time getting it to sit right so that visually it looked even."
4,"I prefer to have very dim nightlights throughout the house for when we wake up in the middle of the night with certain biological needs. These fit the bill very well. Personally I would prefer a red toned light so it doesn't interfere with my night vision, but this light produces just enough to navigate with and not enough to really wake me up while stumbling to the bathroom in a middle of the night daze. Minus one star because they are always on, even though they use very little electricity I would prefer for them to turn off when not needed, and because it doesn't come in red."
5,"very bright, good lightbulbs. seem well constructed. have been working fine for the last month or two. would buy again if the price is right"
5,good
5,"I ordered the Legend 809071 knob to replace a rusted knob on one of our trailers (mobile home). This trailer happens to have a thinner door, so I was sceptical about the fit of the new knob. Having looked around I found that the trailer supply companies were asking for a ridiculous price on these things. I turned to trusty Amazon and found what I was looking for and it was less than half the price. The knob arrived on time and was an easy install. The directions also gave instructions on how to accommodate various door widths. If your in need of a quality knob at a good price, this should work for you. Also.........The door had an existing extended door latch so I swapped the latches and it worked like a charm."
5,Works exactly as described. Replaced a 6 40W bulbs.
5,"couldn't figure out why my garage opener would go halfway down and then back up....Googled it and this was the reason....they 'eyes' were not working! ordered this product, installed it quickly and boom! garage opener works!"
5,A simply bolt lock at a reasonable price. Thanks Amazon!
5,This Aqua Fresh WF289 works as good as the Samsung original filter....at a fraction of the cost.
3,I really love this 3-D Honey Onyx with the granite black insert and would love to utilize it...but when ordered & paid for the company then sent an email that my order was received & processed and then an email that it was sent and on it's way THEN all of a sudden my money was returned. I later sent an email to the company and they wanted me to call them long distance. Not very reliable company if the emails don't reflect what is happening. I ordered 3 of the 12X12 pieces. Either they are in business to sell their product or not. Evidently they are not. Buyer be aware.
5,"The Nest Learning Thermostat is a great upgrade to a smart thermostat. The Nest was very easy to install and the included instructions were very easy to follow, making installation only about 20 minutes. I probably spent more time re-spackling and repainting the wall that our old thermostat covered after installing the Nest (The Nest has a very small profile and doesn't take up as much space on the wall as the old thermostat). Nest.com even has a video tutorial on their website to help you walkthrough the installation process if you need it. Everything you need to install the Nest is included in the box, so just use your existing wiring that came with your old thermostat.<br /><br />The Nest is also simple to use and it makes saving energy fun (as well as addictive). :) We had this now for a little over a month, and we look forward to seeing how much we have saved with this neat little appliance."
5,I use it to hold stuff in a large back basket. Works great. Not much to say about a bungie net!
3,"Does not look as nice or realistic off as the wax covered Smart Living candle, but is good for outdoors for that reason. The actual color of the lit candle could be a little more orangey, as shown in the picture..."
5,Soooo cute! It is truly a small lamp (smaller than I thought) but it's perfect for a nursery when you just want a little light when nursing or changing a diaper in the middle of the night
5,Replaced original seal which had developed mold. Very easy to install; hardest part is taking apart the washing machine; the bellow installation itself is very straight forward.
5,Perfect replacement for my Liftmaster opener. 29 years old and back in action. Fast shipping and much easier than replacing the whole unit.
5,very satisfaid
3,These are pretty dim and very yellow/orange in flame color. I'd have to say they look nothing like a real candle when turned on.
4,for the most part they were great. I did have some that would not hold the screws
4,"Very easy to install. No problems, but after about a week, I can still taste a little difference in the water from the original Kenmore filter."
5,"So far working well, I checked through the cleanout in our septic and seems everything is breaking down as remended by our service advisor. Easy to use, put into toilet, wait for pouch to disolve and then flush, I flush a couple times to make sure all gets to tank."
4,"Switch is great, but what a pain to install/get working properly. Easier to use than an air switch. We had problems with the electrical unit and had to send it back for a replacement. Our granite installer made the hole too big, so we've had a hard time getting it to seat properly. You must make sure the fiber optic cable is pushed in as far as it can go, or the switch won't work. Overall, it's a good purchase, just needs some patience during the installation."
5,These are great knobs and look really good with our dark brown shaker style cabinets. The simple design adds the perfect amount of accent.
5,Great fit for my odd sized HVAC system.
3,the shipping was fast and it was boxed good. the house itself is cute. the only thing i didnt like is the &#34;curtains&#34; on the top window are clearly just drawn on with a red pen. other than that the workmanship was ok. the lights came on at dark and are super bright white. the only real complaint is that it came out of the box with the left foot broke off of the gnome sitting on the roof. the broken part was not inside the box either. too much hassle to send it back over a small thing so we are just going to keep and repair it ourself. i was just happy the lights worked and it was cute.
5,love the salt lamps
5,Great and speedy service
5,"Fits daughters surface pro computer, medicine and cards. Great idea at dorm, fits in drawer well. VERY HEAVY"
2,Not nearly as bright as the small cheap Cree that I carry all the time that uses a CR123 battery 3V. I thought I would be able to use a cheaper AA battery but sorely disappointed. I assume if you compare more apples to apples this little flashlight is fine. The Cree I have is so bright that if it comes on accidentally in my pocket it can burn your leg!! So the new one is in the drawer for emergency but I am back with the Cree and looking hard at the Olight S-10 or the little Fenix.
4,I had a small problem installing it but with advice from customer service got it right. Initially it would often cycle again just after I locked or unlocked it but after the second firmware update (easy to install) it's working fine. I have a key fob and smartphone but when I activated the app in the smartphone it quit recognizing the key fob. I didn't expect that but I no longer can leave the house without noticing if I've inadvertently left my phone behind!
1,"Smaller than the one we had in our last house. Bought from Lowes the outside dimensions were the same but when I went to get in it, it was smaller. And to top it off unless the water is filled to the tippy top it throws it on the walls. And yes, I tipped the nozzles down as far as they would go.<br /><br />Pretty disgusted with this product and feel I got screwed."
5,"The ViriBright Benchmark LED bulb is an excellent quality bulb. Matrix Lighting has done an amazing job at mimicking the color temperature of a burning tungsten filament that we are used to with traditional incandescent 60 watt bulbs.<br /><br />Humans have evolved throughout the history of the world lighting their environments with fire. Campfires, candlelights, gas lantern, and incandescent bulbs. That is the core of the problem with CFL and LED bulbs to date... we want fire, we don't want the cold, pulsating, and frequency humming light generated by many of the CFL and LED bulbs sold today.<br /><br />But this ViriBright bulb offers what we want. A true 2900 color correlated temperature. I've seen other bulbs claim these numbers and lower, 2700 in one case, but no LED light I've seen comes this close to looking like a incandescent.<br /><br />This bulb is also running at 10 watts, which is a lot of bang for you wattage.<br /><br />For reference, here's some of the bulbs I've tested and use:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00AYII2YE SWITCH - SWITCH75 - 18.5 Watt - 2700K Warm White - Clear LED Light Bulb - 1100 Lumen]] - This bulb is probably the reining all around champ. It's bright at 1100 Lumen, has a great color of 2700, solid build, and is liquid cooled so that you can put it in enclosed fixtures. But it runs at 18.5 watts and is expensive. It's also hot as hell after running for awhile. The light spreads evenly throughout the room.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B006OTAE8Y Philips 418590 17-Watt A21 LED Household Light Bulb, Dimmable]] For the price, this is a great bulb. Perhaps the color looks a little too \\""orange\\"" and not enough \\""fire\\"". The light spreads well but is more directional than the Switch and the ViriBright. It's also bright at 1100 lumen. It runs at 17 watts. This is air-cooled, like the ViriBright, and cannot be placed in an enclosed fixture.<br /><br />I've used and tested other older technologies but would not buy these new bulbs new today, so I'll leave them out for now. If I was to buy new bulbs today, the ViriBright, the Switch, and the Philips are what will be added to my cart.<br /><br />An advantage of the ViriBright is that it is running at 10 watts, compared to the 18.5 and 17 in the above examples. The disadvantage is that it only outputs 800 lumens compared to the 1100 in the above examples. A disadvantage of the ViriBright and Philips bulb is that they cannot be placed in an enclosed fixture, the Switch can. The color of all three of the bulbs are good.<br /><br />I'd recommend this ViriBright bulb in lamps or open-air fixture of a room where more than one will be used. I could see three of these lighting a room really well. Bravo, excellent product.e them out for now.

5,This is probably the third one of these I've purchased - love the Chili Pepper theme for my decor. My water has issues which is why it needs replacing but love it every time.
3,These work fine as warm accent lighting but look elsewhere if you require brighter lights as these just emit a glow
5,"Now I switched to the new curly bulb and I'm saving electric. Other timers similar to this only work with incandescent bulbs. This one works with all. Same wiring a regular on/off switch 2 wires. Don't have to worry about power failures and resetting the timer. It has a lithium ion battery for memory back up, also has daylight savings time automatic (if you want) great product!"
5,Easy to stick up
1,"I use these made by Pur with my Whirlpool refrigerator and they last a month. I tested Total Disolvable Solids with my HM Digital water tester and get a great reading of 46 without the Whirlpool filter. Incredibly when I run water through the filter I get a reading of 47ppm.<br /><br />I have had a bad experience with either the filter, the fridge it was built for with an in the door ice maker or the combination of the two. I now keep a filtered pitcher in my fridge and get Zero ppm.<br /><br />No one at Whirlpool seemed to care enough after I spent $1500 on a new refrigerator and had service come out several times. They said it must be my water. Tests proved otherwise. My old Kenmore(made by Whirlpool) worked great with it old style filter."
5,Product is as advertized. Good price in bundles.
5,Excellent product!
4,"They are less rubbery then expected, but still work. The rubber is more like some type of foam."
5,Bought this doorbell button to go with our [[ASIN:B001CMLAZ4 Honeywell RCWL300A1006 Premium Portable Wireless Door Chime and Push Button]]. Took less than five minutes for me to set up and install outside by our back door. Works great and have had no issues.
5,It was super easy to set up! The app that you have to use is very user friendly. Had it working in less than 5 minutes. My wife and I love this product and would Def recommend it. Also is much cheaper than other smart bulbs which is a plus.
4,"It looks good and good for my use in the space I have in my bathroom. It is costly, but not too many choices I can find in the market."
5,Huntington Brass has been know to manufacture high quality products and this shower head is another perfect example. I am pleased with the durable construction and overall great quality. The flow of water is great too. Much better quality than the product you would find a Home Depot or Lowe's.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
1,"Total JUNK. Worked maybe 2 days, died and never came back. No way to contact seller. Do not buy light is a joke. Followed all instructions but still junk!!!"
5,Great and affordable.
5,"Perfect for the bathroom, low light but enough to see where you're going. Good price point too."
4,"Husband wanted it, researched it, found it, bought it, and smiled when it arrived in the mail."
2,"Looks great --- sounds awful. Installed 3 of them and entire house buzzes when all 3 are on. Other existing ceiling fans are silent in the house by comparison. Regret the purchase. Nice hanging sculpture as it stands. UPDATE: After 2 years, I'm replacing them one by one. The buzz is awful."
5,"Bought 4 total, they all work as expected. Just a note, it's 3200k temperature light, so it's a good amount whiter light than incandescent bulbs. These probably belong in the bathroom/kitchen more than a bedroom/family room. Arrived quick but those tubes they come in are annoying."
1,"It did not come with the hardware kit which is needed to install it. Unfortunately, it is out of the return window so I can't return it - I wish I had opened it as soon as I got it."
5,Works very smoothly to dim lights. Pairs with Pico easily as long as you take the time to read the instructions how to do it.
5,"Pretty quick install, works great. Very happy customer!"
3,"The door sweep itself seems to be well manufactured, but each of the four door sweeps I ordered has one of more spots of unpainted aluminum which ruins their appearance."
5,I like these bulbs so far especially considering their low price.
5,"Lamp is beautiful, I hope to get one for every room. Was a mix-up with the size, however the seller was very responsive and resolved it quickly. The great customer service earned my business again and I've already placed another order."
5,"Great !!! It was easy to install and it produces at least 150% more light than the Mercury vapor 175W light that is mounted 40' apart on the same building. I varied from the instructions somewhat. I mounted the mounting bracket first, then ruffed in the wiring all the way to the power source, then fully assembled the light [ photo cell, bulb, and cowling ] so when I went back up the ladder the second time, all I had to do was mount the light on the swing bracket, wire nut the wires together, and swing the fixture into it's lock position, drop the locking pin in and it was done."
1,Missing the programming instructions
4,"Awesome. Works great, no more sharing a showerhead with wife. My only critique is that the steel tube did not seal well when leaving the splitter. Solved by using the extra washer that is supposed to be fore hooking to the outlet. Came with plumbers tape which was nice."
5,This MicroSolar solar spot light is the real deal. It's brighter than I expected and doesn't leak with heavy rain. It also provides light for a long duration - through the night in the summer. Tried both Lowes and Home Depot solar spot lights before this one and the MicroSolar is definitely better. I also love the standard 16ft. cord so I can remote the extra large solar panel to a more sunny location.
5,works
5,works good
2,"I bought these to install in our bathrooms to provide a little ambient light so we wouldn't have to turn on the main lights at night. The sensor works well and the light is plenty bright (brighter than I prefer actually), but there are two things that really annoy me. First, the bracket requires that the light be installed as shown in the pictures - that is, the LED shines down. I wanted the opposite - I wanted to mount the lights near the ceiling, shining up, so that a soft reflected glow would light the room. The light is much more pleasing that way. The bracket doesn't allow this configuration (it falls off the wall if you try), so I ended up just using the double-side sticky tape to mount it the way I wanted. That's fine for now, but I worry I'm going to rip the paint off the wall when it's time to replace the batteries, not to mention the tape may not re-stick.<br /><br />The second problem is the short duration of the light. It only stays on for about 30 seconds, which is not enough time for me to finish my...umm...business in the middle of the night, leaving me standing at the toilet in total darkness. It doesn't work to wave my arm to re-activate it as the sensor is not sensitive enough for that. You have to move your whole body several inches, which is not a smart thing to do when you're peeing in total darkness. Worse, it does reactivate as I walk away, unnecessarily lighting an empty room for another 30 seconds.<br /><br />I don't know if another night light would have been a better choice, but knowing what I know now I wish I had done more research."
5,It did a great job. Pretty easy to create a nice wood grain on flat surfaces.
5,"works great, does what it says and fits perfect. Any plumber can make this work"
2,Doesn't fit average size faucet hose without rigging it .
5,"Well I can now obsess over the old lady changing the temperature from out of the house! oh the joy. That old bat insists she can feel a difference between 71 and 70 degrees. I called bs on her and she dropped the hammer. Out with the old 1970s thermostat and in with the future!!! Currently we are running our house at 68 and she hasn't said a peep yet. We had an thumb wrestling match to see who would be the first Thermo-Master of the casa and I was able to best her 2 out of three. She has these enormous thumbs and insane reach, if it were not for my ninja quick movement I would have been pinned. I get to tell the old lady now to chill out digitally!!<br /> Long Live Thermo-Master the First!!!!"
5,Item better than expected and shipped well packed and on time. It comes with all needed attachments. Highly recommended for small areas.
5,"Since I am reviewing four products today I will copy and paste this review into all four for easy cross reference for anyone else who goes through what I did. All four products came from Sanford and Son? Overhead Doors and fulfilled by Amazon. All four shipped quickly and arrived very fast. The three Genie parts were the same as the originals. I was replacing the Genie 34107R.S Screw Drive Carriage which had stripped and was no longer opening the door (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CST1L4/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_14). I believe this stripped because the Limit Switches were installed in a shabby fashion on my garage door opener, the Genie Excelerator screw drive system, and the open limit switch (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00286CVAQ/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3 ) stopped working (both switches, for some reason, the wires were run under the switch itself and srewed onto the rail, which caused them to strip over time because the wires were not tied down properly using the clips; versus just using the clips and tying the excess wire in a loop with a twist tie at the end closest the power head assembly) . The Excelerator will shut off when enough force is exerted on the bumper mechanism, so even though the open limit switch stopped working the door would stop once it pushed hard enough against the bumper. However, this use of force to shut down the system over time wore down the screw drive carriage (took a little over a month for me). Since the close door limit switch (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00283OBXY/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_8) had also been installed improperly and also seemed like it was having problems (sometimes it seemed to work, sometimes it seemed force was taking over) I decided to replace the whole setup. So, two new limit switches, a new screw drive carriage, and a tube of the grease folks seemed to recommend over the higher priced Genie brand 3 pack (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FJ07W2/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_7) and I'm back in business. I am no expert, believe me, but the install of all three was a very easy one person job. Simply release the carriage from the Curved Door Arm, unscrew the one screw from the Head Bracket, and lift the rail high enough to slip off the old drive carriage. Have the new carriage ready to go and slip that right on. Lower the rail back on the head bracket and screw it back in place. Reconnect to the Curved Door Arm. The limit switches unscrew and screw easily back on. The wire clips just pop off very easily and are easy to reuse. The new limit switches do not come with the screws that hold them in place, so make sure to keep your existing screws because you will need to reuse them. I used the clips to hold down excess limit switch wire until I reached the Power Head Assembly, and then I just rolled up the rest of the excess, tied it up with a twist tie, and laid that on top of the Power Head Assembly. The greasing directions that Genie provides with their grease (available here from the Homedepot site ([...]) has you wipe down the rail before you put the new grease, and then wiping off excess once you grease the screw drive shaft. Not sure how necessary that is, but I did it, and then found I needed to do a few runs of grease along the rail to lube it up right. Maybe they meant wipe off mess that does not go on the drive shaft or rail...because you need the grease on those. One final note, once I reassembled eveything I realized the rail was not straight because the carriage was moving on an angle. It turns out that the Rail Strap had bent (this thing is heavy metal) presumably because of force causing the door to stop closing instead of the close limit switch. I had to go back and take that off and bend it by hand to straighten it out. Two months later and all is working...although I need to hire somebody to come out and balance my door because I realized when I took everything apart that the door came down very hard when not connected to the system and it should almost be balanced and not go down at all. Since balancing a door could be a bit dangerous I am choosing not to try that."
5,"When you need a high wattage, this is the only game in town. As an electrical contractor I steer all my customers to this series. I have never had a burn out and the last forever. The only downside is they have not updated the look in sometime, especially the knob which turns some people off, seems dated."
5,"My 70lb puppy likes to take a running leap onto my couch and with tile floors, the couch can end up moving a few feet. The first time he jumped on the couch after placing these under the legs, the couch stayed put!"
5,"I bought the metro dryer. The power really blows the water off. The noise is the same as a vaccum..(could be problem). It makes there hair lay down really pretty. I was using a regular blow dryer, cuts the drying time in half without having too much heat. I have 2 Cavalier king charles with floor lenght hair."
4,"Are exactly what they appear to be - inexpensive, shielded alligator clips that mount / push onto the end of multimeter leads . You can tell what they're like, including the insulation by looking at the picture. Work exactly as expected. Should work with any brand leads / multimeter. Quite useful when working with PCBs / small components. Glad I bought them. No more to say."
5,"I've usually bought fairly cheap shower heads for our family use, but I was looking to replace a clogged head in a shower often used by guests. So I looked for something a little more upscale that would have a luxurious feel to the water stream. I was a little concerned with some comments that this didn't put out much water, but since we have good water pressure decided to try this it based on the majority of reviews. It's been great. There's plenty of water flow and the pattern and pressure have the luxurious feel I was looking for. I'm expecting to remodel the family bathrooms soon and will probably go with this same showerhead or similar from the same manufacturer."
5,"We wanted a ladder tall enough so we could get on top of our fifth wheel RV, and compact enough to store and take with us when we traveled. This Xtend & Climb telescoping ladder does everything it was advertised to, and all we wanted."
5,The item was sent as described.
1,"The seat I received was not natural teak. It is some darkly varnished wood and I can tell from looking at the unfinished pieces on the bottom that is not even teak. When I contacted Amazon, that others reported a similar problem and that they have addressed the issue with the manufacturer and \\""refreshed their stock.\\"" I sent it back and ordered a replacement... same exact problem! Very frustrating."
4,project complete now
5,"I broke one of the cheap hoses that came with the vessel sink/faucet combo below:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VOEAEQ/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />Bought these and they were MUCH better quality, bending more easily (but not breaking/cracking) and the seals didn't leak even after the first time tightening them. Do be weary however that the hoses may be SLIGHTLY larger in diameter that what I replaced - I needed to enlarge the holes in the countertop using a wood router (these hoses were a couple of mm larger)."
3,"Item is much smaller than description photo, it came rolled poorly in a box, but that didn't affect the decals.<br />What's disappointing is that the long branch was poorly precut, which tore a bit and the whole branch became tangled. I could not use that piece.<br />Other than that it adds life to a dull wall. Just wish the longer piece was easier to use."
5,"So far, these have worked a quite well. I have them on my fence in my backyard. They are out in all kinds of weather, and are holding up. I mounted the solar panel to the top of the fence post, so it gets a lot of sun, and they stay on for quite a while. They are bright, but instead of being white they are more blue."
5,Fit exactly where the other was
5,Works great for floating down the river
5,"Great price, would purchase again."
5,"Great substitute for power hungry, halogens! Really like this light but more like a 40 watt equivalent. I will buy again."
5,This replacement woked good. It is so convenient not to have to go out to find such a product. Great.
5,great deal
5,Great to have the proper tool to do a job!
5,I need the extra light to work in a dim space. 250 watts is what it takes to get my edits done!
5,perfect replacement bulb. fit well and works great. Price considerably cheaper than that of oem. Works great on my 150 gal. saltwater tank with 13 fish.
5,"This plastic door track was perfect for my project. I do recommend attaching with small nails, as the first time i glued it with carpenters glue it didn't stay glued. Doing another project that requires some more track and I found it cheaper, with free ship to store at a 'Do It Best' hardware store online."
5,"My home's nineteen-year-old LP Gas water heater was starting to show its age: brown rusty water, high gas bills, and a gas smell every time we went into the garage. While the old gas water heater still worked, we didnt want to wait and be stuck with no hot water and a 2 year old needing her bath time. It was time to begin looking for a new water heater.<br />My wife and I had noticed many commercials advertising the efficiency of instant gas water heaters. Even our gas company had a deal with financing. After asking a professional on Green Home Guide we focused our search on finding a heater that has a high Energy Factor (EF).<br />We researched the following water heating technologies:<br />1. Solar thermal: The best on energy factor however didnt meet our budget and had to be installed on the south side of our roof which was the front of the house. My wife didnt like that.<br />2. LP Gas tankless: The energy factor is around .94 and is consider by most to be morek water heater we currently had at .63 efficiency. Honestly this was the one we thought we would go with from the start. However, I would advise you to weigh the pros and cons before purchase. We found out we would need a water softener to prolong the heat exchanger, warranty coverage, and a larger duct vent through the roof than the one we currently had. A three to four inch duct vent is required. This added 40% to the original price quote. We also noticed a lot of false promises on true savings.<br />3. Electric tankless: The energy factor was comparable to the gas instant/tankless. However we needed to upgrade our electrical panel for the install because the electric instant water heater pulls more amps than the standard tank water heater. Plus they advised us a water-softener or pre-filter would be a good idea too.<br />4. Hybrid water heater: This product appealed to us because it was the most innovative and had the highest efficiency -- EF 2.35. Plus it was a lot cheaper than going thermal solar water heating. It also still qualified for the Energy Star tax credit, and was more efficient than gas instant or electric instant water heating.<br />We decided to buy the hybrid, a GeoSpring Hybrid-Electric Heat-Pump Hot Water Heater.<br />What ultimately made me buy a Geo Spring water heater?<br />There are several factors I considered.<br /> The product and the GE website information were great.<br /> High efficiency over conventional models without having to go thermal solar. I understand thermal solar watering heating is the best. However so is the hybrid water heater in my opinion and the return on investment is shorter.<br /> Price was less than going thermal solar with having to install panels on my roof.<br /> No commission to a sales person.<br /> Warranty.<br /> Tax write off! Use IRS tax form 5695.<br /> Easy to install. I didnt have to install a gas tank, or cut holes in my roof to go thermal solar. I could put it in myself! This oight and other ways to learn about appliances or ways to save energy and protect the environment at the same time.<br />From $1,038 per year to $250.56 per year<br />Based on DOE test procedure, my projected energy costs for water heating with the GeoSpring will go from $1,038/year to $250.56, a reduction of 76%. That means I'll recoup a return on investment (ROI) in less than two years, not counting the $300 Energy Star tax deduction or the 27% reduction in kWh rate I'll get from my utility by moving into a lower usage tier. My cost for the GeoSpring water heater was $1,356 and I installed it myself. I estimate it would cost $300 to have a licensed plumber install it.<br />I should mention Im a Florida State electrical contractor, active RESNET Class 1 HERS Rater, and I installed this unit myself. However, that didnt mean I knew how to install one of these or knew all the answers on efficiency. I found several YouTube videos on how to install one of these and read the installation instructi back, picked up the material I would need to do the job and installed it without any problems. I think it took me longer to take that old LP Gas water heater out and clean and paint the area prior to installing the new heater.<br />I should also mention it works great. My wife is happy with plenty of hot water, no complaints, plus we have a garden Jacuzzi tub and it filled it up with plenty of hot water. I keep the setting in the eHeat (most efficient EF 2.55) mode most of the year and in the Hybrid (EF 2.35) mode in the winter months in Florida.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary<br />Please do your own research. I live in Florida where the Geo Spring Hybrid will work great because its warm most of the year and the incoming ground water temperature is around 75 degrees.<br />However, if I lived in Ohio I would never install one of these because the temperature split is too high. The incoming ground water temperature there would be around 55 degrees. Most people would require LP Gas or Natural Gas fueeat more efficiently in that climate.<br />What should you check prior to installing a Geo-Spring water heater?<br />Location: The GeoSpring gives off 56-db of noise which is less than a box type fan running. If installing indoors fan noise, space required, and condensation drain will have to be considered. If installing in a closet the door will have to be vented to allow air to circulate around Heat-Pump. This unit works best with 700 cubic feet of air around unit for proper air circulation. I installed mine in the garage where its warmer and has space around it to evaporate the warm air to heat the water more efficiently.<br /><br />Climate: Southern states in my opinion would be the best option on increased energy savings.<br /><br />Cost: Check around, I purchased mine at Lowe's and extended the warranty up to 10 years for $80 dollars after the one year warranty runs out.<br /><br />Contractor: Are they licensed? Did they pull a permit?<br /><br />Needs: Do I need a 40 gallon, 50 or an 80? Geo-Sonly comes in a 50 gallon at this time. However we have a garden Jacuzzi tub and it fills it up just fine with plenty of hot water.<br /><br />Full article: http://greenhomeguide.com/how-i-cut-my-energy-bill-for-water-heating-by-76"
4,worked as expected
5,It is exactly as I expected . . . very easy to use and clean and works well. I would recommend this for the price as well as the item.
5,Nice lock. Easy to set and use.
1,"After having installed it earlier one day, it alarmed at around 5:00 AM for no reason at all. Needless to say it was defective and thus unreliable."
2,cheap and balky; velcro adhesive doesn't hold properly
5,"We live in a home that has well water, which at times can get really hard...especially during the winter months in the north east. My wife has been asking for a simplistic solution to bring some sort of filtration to our shower and this product fit the bill. Installation was easy....but I did have to pull out the channel locks to get it done. Recommendation...when using channel lock pliers with this, simply wrap a paper towel or small towel around the area where you will use the pliers...it will avoid unsightly scratches.<br /><br />With well water comes low pressure - which is a problem for us using any shower head. However, I was quite impressed with this shower head. I simply removed the water saving restrictor - as per the instructions - and installed the shower head. While its not the BEST shower I have had...it is adequate for most low pressure situations.....especially because the shower head has an easy to turn dial with multiple spray/massage configurations.<br /><br />Great value, great filtration, and excellent settings."
5,"I have 3 of these in use. Now, on a 3-gallon toilet, I use less water overall than a new &#34;efficient&#34; model. I only had one fail after 4 years - and their Customer Service immediately shipped me another one for free, with no questions asked."
1,"This leaked so badly, from everywhere possible. We even tried higher quality plumbers tape, with little improvement in the leaking."
5,"Was a gift for my grandson. He works odd jobs for friends and it makes it easy when he has electric tools to keep things neat. Wprks as designed, easier to handle than loose extension chord."
5,"I had to replace my old model like this. It was 15 years old and just rusted out on the inside. So I went with the same model, it was easy to install and is much quieter than the old one. Would buy again."
5,Great price and filters water exactly as described.
3,"I purchased these because I knew I would need them to secure my Budge Max SUV Cover. These are adequate bungee cords with clips and will work well. However, I think they are overprices. I decided I needed two additional straps so I purchased them locally at a big box hardware store. With four very similar clips and two flat bungee straps I spent about half of what this item cost. Advice: shop around."
1,The Very top part comes apart from the ladder. It is not sturdy only used once and discover that it is defective. Will not recommend
5,"Well-made, modestly priced, easy to install. You will need to buy a hose with proper fittings for your sink. Adjustable flow? Use the faucet it's attached to."
4,My last door bell worked well . for a while I hope this one works a lot longer and better
5,Might be some of the last bulbs I buy. Very happy with my choice. Telling all my friends to check um out.<br />As prices come down these will be very in demand.
3,Easy to use but the glue is not strong enough and easy to come off.
5,cute cute
5,They were easy to install and 10 X brighter then the original. I would recommend this produce to everyone I know.<br />Thanks again.
5,Nice wall plate
5,"This was an exact replacement for my Kenmore 80 Series washer. Perfect fit, less than an hour to replace. There are free videos out there that will show you exactly what to do."
5,Brilliant product. Easy installation. Three wires -- wire nuts included.<br />I am getting 3 more for placement around the house.
5,The light kit looks great on the Brewster fan. It doesn't come with the glass covers. You'll have to buy that seperately.
5,I am very pleased with this product. It works exactly as advertised. The price was reasonable. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a wireless alarm.
5,"It's easy to set up and use, and has a variety of different tones and rings, so you can change to whatever makes you happy at the time! The ringer needs to be plugged in to the wall, but the switch is battery-powered, so it can go wherever you need one!"
5,"I am SO GLAD I found this on Amazon as you can't find them much or at all in stores locally it seems.<br /><br />This simple little inexpensive and uncomplicated invention makes a big difference in one of those little ways that matter.<br /><br />How many times and ways do we experience \\""little\\"" annoyances that happen all too often. Nothing major but a source of irritation. Like, for instance, taking a nice shower after working outside getting ready to relax and chill but its always annoying hitting that little bump in the middle of the shower rod that sometimes leaves the curtain coming off one or two of the hooks which have to be put back eventually before the hooks fall off. Or the fact that it just looks messy. But mostly for me its that \\""struggle\\"" every time I shower.<br /><br />This hasn't revolutionized my world, I haven't experienced any huge financial changes one way or the other on account of it. It just makes my life a little smoother and that's nice.<br /><br />Everytime I get out of the shower now I am reminded of what's missing, that annoying tug. And I admit I feel a little smug because I found an answer to something that's no big deal. It is, however, something I think a lot of people have just learned to live with. How can something so small be so nice and make me so glad I found, for this one \\""issue\\"" in my life - an answer.<br /><br />The only thing I would say as advice as to \\""how to\\"" install it is that you will probably have to cut off a few inches from one end or the other. That's what I did which was no big deal. Thing is, though, there is a sticker on one end (manufacturers seem to LOVE STICKERS that you can't UN-STICK to save yourself) that is aesthetically a small blemish detracting from the \\""tidiness\\"" I like. If I had noticed ahead of time there was this sticker which is about an inch and a half long that is the end I would have cut off but as luck happens so often, if there is a 50-50 chance of getting it \\""right\\"" I got it wrong. So I had to try to scratch off this sticker thing which I wasn't totally successful at but \\""enough\\"" to get by. It's not a huge thing but nice if you get it right and cut off the sticker end instead of the unblemished part. That's the only thing that could have made this nicer. I HATE STICKERS. What is the love affair anyway with stickers that defy removing? I don't notice it much or at all, I just know its there and it would have been better without it.<br /><br />Anyway, with or without the sticker this has made my life more pleasant in one of those little simple ways that makes me a happier person. Who knew happiness comes in such small ways? A NICE, SMOOTH addition to an otherwise \\""rough\\"" world - and it doesn't cost a fortune, the shipping was SUPER FAST, actually delivered by a carrier service within a couple of days which was a nice surprise too. I highly recommend it so you too, can be among the smugly self-satisfied who don't have to tug at the shower curtain AGAIN, a solution easy, fast and cheap. What could be better?<br /><br />I'm glad they had an option here on Amazon to buy JUST ONE because I don't need a box of 20. The option I found for one combined with the shipping fee was still probably cheaper than if I had found one locally. It pays to shop around and check your options.So I had to try to scratch off this sticker thing which I wasn't totally successful at but \\""enough\\"" to get by.

5,"We installed a wood stove. The floor joists below were suspended by Teco hangers. Yeah, yeah, I know that they are really strong...but I was paranoid about having a 400 pound red hot inferno load suspended by some folded up sheet metal...so I used a 4x4 to span the joists and snugged it using these jack posts. Did I accomplish anything? Heck, I don't know. But I sleep better at night. So for that, I give these jack posts 5 stars. If you buy them, you just might sleep better too."
5,"This review is being written 6/9/2013 for the Zoeller 30-0181 Check Valve, 1-1/2 Inch, sold and shipped by third party vendors who advertise on the Amazon website.<br /><br />The precursor to this model had a slightly different design where the valve came apart in the middle with four bolts, and the flapper was a replaceable item. This model is sealed and the flapper is not replaceable. This valve has the same rugged flapper design (reinforced with a metal disk) as the previous design. The flapper opens completely, unlike many cheaper valves, hence the \\""full-flow\\"" claim. However, do note that this check valve is a 1 1/4\\"" design with universal rubber couplings that connect it to either 1 1/4\\"" or 1 1/2\\"" PVC pipe. Therefore, if you use 1 1/2\\"" PVC piping, you will not get the same amount of flow through this valve as you would with a model that has a 1 1/2\\"" minimum diameter. This design allows Zoeller to sell one product with a single set of rubber couplers for both applications. Turn the rubber couplings one way or the other to accommodate the correct PVC pipe diameter for your application. Also note that this check valve does \\""klunk\\"" with a loud snap. If you are concerned about the noise, you may want to consider another model with a different design. Otherwise, if you want a reliable, high quality check valve, this is a good choice.<br /><br />I've uploaded some pictures to show the full flow design and the orientation of the rubber couplers."
5,We live in a new neighborhood in San Antonio. There is construction going on all around us so dirt is in the air all of the time. We are also well known to have very minimal rainfall in S. Texas. We have tried so many different air filters but these seem to work the best for us. Will continue to buy these from Amazon as they have the best prices.
4,Works as expected!
5,"Works great and strong enough to handle crawl space issues. I get water when we have heavy rains, but crawlspace stays dry."
4,There are a couple of intentional holes in the bottom of the sink to equalize pressure and prevent the vessel from cracking an popping during the firing process in the kiln. These were not properly sealed up for sale of the item and subsequently they leaked when running water through the overflow. I was able to effectively seal these holes with ABS compound and fix the problem. This should not be up to the consumer to fix. Otherwise its a nice looking/functioning vessel sink.
5,Love it!
5,I've modified my heater for SURFING application from my mini-van and it works FLAWLESSLY even during cold windy mornings!! Friends and strangers/fellow surfers are amazed at how compact and effective it is!!
5,Great solution for grab bar/ shower shelf combo.
5,Works perfectly. Using it for monitoring front door of a retail establishment.
4,Ok
5,"I got three of these for my smartthings Z-Wave. I got fed up with minor leaks. That I was lucky to catch... So no I have three of them in the house.. The bathroom, laundry room and boiler room. Conection was easy for the smartthings took me 10 min to set the tree of them up and test them.. So now if I have a issue with water leak or accident!"
5,The best light!
5,This tool helped me add an electrical outlet for a second refrigerator and determine that the amperage pulled by the new refrig would not interfere with another appliance on the same circuit. This saved me from running a separate wire directly from the electrical box. I can also see how much electricity is used at any outlet and confirm the amount of &#34;vampire&#34; electrical usage is happening. Vampire usage is what our TVs and computers and printers are using in their off or dormant state. Gave one as a gift and the person loves it.
5,Good quality and have always preferred this style of door stop ... and if you have a large heavy door you can use one in each hinge to &#34;stop the door&#34; in a balanced manner.
1,"I spent over $200 on this light when it first came out. What kind of people spend over $200 on a flashlight? 90% of time is from law enforcement professional or military people. What good is a light if you can't depend on it? 1/2 of the time when you rotate the tail cap it won't turn on, this is ESPECIALLY true when you leave the light unused for a while and I'm not talking about months. Maybe a week or tow. Sometime you wonder if the batter is dead or not. What a waste of money. I will try to contact the company to see if they can fix it. It has been a true disappoinment."
5,It's very uplifting! LMAO
4,"This is an excellent product. I've owned several. I give them to my residents. The light is very bright , the charges last a long time and the brightest area of the light is in the center. Unfortunately, they're getting hard to find."
5,it is very good
5,This is a fantastic deal! I would have spent $160 at Lowe's for the same type of lights. They area easy to install only took me 30 minutes. Mine didn't come with direction or I didn't find them at least but I still managed to figure it out. You will want to hot glue them because the sticky tape won't last.
3,This would be a five star rating if the hand rail had wasn't so slick and slippery. It is beautiful though and looks so nice in my shower.
5,As advertised
1,"Very weak plastic construction. I bought one and after just 90 days, started to leak due to the plastic cracks. It is really so cheap done, that of course does not last. I do not recommend this item. Just go for a metal one with a solid construction that last."
4,Excellent product
2,"I'm sure that the bulbs work for what they are intended, but these are not Candelabra base bulbs. Wish they would have worked for my application..."
5,"A beautiful, well crafted-chandelier that really brings out our living room. We had to hire a professional electrician to hang it, but once we did, they got it installed right away."
5,"So far so good. Set up was easy, works fine."
5,everything went great
5,Nice color and easy to assemble. Looks as I expected and good quality. Worth the price. I plan to get more
5,I owned two other models and this is the best I have found
5,Nice to get 3 filters for 99.00$. They are usually about $44 at bestbuy or hardware store in the area!
5,Works great!
5,"My mom's brand new refrigerator went through a flood. We had lights in the fridge but nothing else. After spending some time talking to repair guys who didn't want to mess with it I found this. After it had been cleaned thoroughly we put this control board in and her refrigerator came back to life. It works awesomely. It brought hope back to a family who had lost almost everything. Sometimes it only takes one little thing to brighten your life, this was my mom's one little thing. Thank You."
5,"Product arrived on time, was easy to install, and worked perfectly. I followed the advice of other reviewers and did not replace the original pulley assemblies. Essentially this means that I paid a pretty high price for a set of glorified strings, but they do work perfectly and that's what matters."
5,Just as advertised!
5,Installed and working. Thank you
5,"Our three year old refrig/ice maker would not close, needed new hinge. Had to pay repair man to install, but it worked.I think it was always defective but we didn't know it until our son in law noticed it. Working well now."
1,"The lock on this safe broke after about three weeks of use. If it can't be locked, I assume that it is no longer waterproof or fire safe. Don't waste your money on this item!"
5,"I finally found a shower head that produces desirable flow rates/settings...I only wish that this particular model came in oil rubbed bronze. I will continue to use this showerhead until such time as I want to sell my current house. At that time I will switch the showerhead out with one that I purchased in oil rubbed bronze. Until then, I will continue to use the brushed nickel shower head."
5,Absolutely perfect for the corner of my room. I put a different shade on it but its exactly what I was looking for .
5,As listed
5,We really like these for our boat. They are heavy duty and a good medium length. A little longer and stronger than most you see.
5,"Home depot sells this unit but under a different #, I was hoping they would do a price match so if I had a problem I wouldn't have to ship it back, they didn't. I saved enough to risk it and the unit worked great."
5,I bought this for my wife for her charity work. It's lightweight and easy for her to use.
4,Good not great. Does go well with my living room. Very easy to hang.
1,"Another one that I had to return because it couldn't cover the distance from gate to house (100' or so). Otherwise, it seemed to work fine - But only for short distances (25' or so). JC"
4,"The timer is rather simple, intended for low demand appliances like LIGHT or RADIOS, etc. Set-up was very simple, and took just 3 minutes. Works fine."
3,"The cold water, is just a bit cooler than room temperature. Not worth the money! I would not recommend buying, I would return it, if it was easier to do so!"
3,"So it's a bit smaller than 8inches and barley fits the GE stove. It's not the same as the others I have, but for the price it is what it is! I will probably end up ordering a correct one but wanted this to get through the holidays! Cheap product and that what I got."
4,"Still trying to figure out why some gave this product a bad review. (?)<br />I replaced the sink, faucet and garbage disposal with no issues. The garbage disposal mounted easily, is quite, has chopped up<br />all that we have fed it and I have found no need to remove the rubber baffle as some have suggested."
2,"Couldn't get it to ring for the life of me. Had to make several changes to the inside before it would work, but still needs more force than just the opening of a door. Screws included also broke when using them. Would not purchase again, though it does look nice despite not working."
5,"I attached it to a Craftmade Model P152 fan. It fit perfectly. Should work on any fan that accommodates a universal light fixture with threaded nipple. The picture does not show it, but there is a threaded nipple protruding from the top of the fixture for installation to the fan. For the Craftmade, I had to remove the plastic button in the bottom center of the fan control housing (where the fan switches are). This light fixture then threads right in. My fan already had wires in the housing for a light fixture, so I just had to attach the two wires from this fixture to those wires. The brass on the fixture is bright brass, but it does have a more buffed look than the mirror-like finish of the fan I attached it to. I can't imagine anyone noticing the difference unless it is pointed out to them. Note that this fixture does not come with shades for the light bulbs. It uses shades with a standard 2 1/4&#34; base, which you can get from a home supply store or here from Amazon."
5,Works great!
5,"Bought eight of these... 4 for hallway ceiling cans-(4&#34;) ... 4 for office ceiling cans (also 4&#34;). As expected (I have used LED modules, similar, but for 6&#34; cans...before, in my kitchen...) they perform brilliantly (pun intended...). warm, bright light washes down the walls...and evenly illuminates everything. This is important in my case, since our hallway has 15 or so paintings and photos on the walls, and like most hallways, has no outside light....<br /><br />I have not tried a dimmer yet....but may.... These are 45 watt equiv...but look a bit brighter!!<br /><br />Love the five year warranty !! I marked each bulb with felt tip pen: &#34;Jun 14 - 5 yr&#34; Satisfied...especially the price... I did a lot of shopping..."
5,I use these 2 for night time and day time lights for my snake. It is just like setting up a digital alarm clock
5,This is a good little shower head. It puts out a good amount of water. It doesn't have super water pressure but I feel like it rinses well. The massage position is good but a semi small stream. It won't cover a large area but it does work pretty good. For the price it is worth it and knowing I'm saving water too.
5,"Excellent item as described. Very good price,fast delivery AAA+<br />Hope to deal with you again. Thank you!"
5,I ordered this lamp for a bedside table in a guest room. The lamp is a perfect size. The lamp is fully supported by the appropriate size base The shade is a wonderful piece of glass (but very sturdy). The touch aspect of turning the lamp on and off works perfectly The lamp has a nice contemporary look. Good Value for the price.
5,"Ordered Dec 15, arrived Dec 18!! Great service and best price."
2,Don't like them. The flow of water is misdirected and most water leaves a stain. You must wipe clean right after using it.
4,"This is a review of my experience in using Restore. I am still in the process of finishing the deck so obviously I do not have any long term results. What I can offer is how easy/difficult it was to apply, texture, coverage, too hot? etc.<br /><br />Coverage: Their website states that 1-4 gallon container will cover a 100 sq-ft area with 2 coats. I used just over 2-4 gallon containers to cover a 14x15 area (or 210 sq-ft) with 2 coats. I also did all the top rails and a few stairs with 2 coats. So, the coverage was spot on (if not better). Why was it spot on for me but poor for others? One possible explanation is that the weather has been relatively cool for this time of the year.<br /><br />Texture: I am specifically looking for the textured feel as we have kids and have friends and family over often for the pool. The texture turned out exactly how I was hoping and am extremely happy. We are not having any issues with it being way too rough to walk on or as others have described, \\""like walking on rocks\\"". Why did the texture turn out ok for us? Possible explanations can be read below...<br /><br />How easy/difficult to apply (and prep): Use their rollers. Do all the necessary prep work - power wash (sand if necessary), mask off any areas (like you house). Their website talks about applying extra material to nail holes and larger cracks before you do the 2nd coat. I took the extra step to fill in any larger cracks and deep nail holes with caulk before I did the first coat (their website also talks about using caulk if necessary). I did this before the first coat because I wanted to eliminate filling in b/t the 1st and 2nd coat. It worked. Filling in the larger nail holes and cracks took some time but not as long as you think - quick bead then swipe with putty knife. I think it saved me time in the long run - plus you don't have to constantly stop and fill stuff in while you're just trying to focus on using the roller. Its just roll and go (in onedirection). I also brushed a light coat of the Restore solid stain in between the deck boards before I applied the thick stuff. This will greatly improve the visual appearance once the thick stuff is applied. I suggest using both the smaller and larger rollers - the smaller works great in the tighter areas. It will be somewhat weird when first applying but just like with anything new you'll find your rhythm. The first coat will be blotchy but the 2nd coat will fill it in nicely. First coat dry time was quick - 3 or 4 hours but I waited til the next day to put the 2nd coat on. I learned that the thicker you put the 2nd coat on AND the less you roll and re-roll over it the better the texture will turn out (less \\""rocky\\""). The material will start to lay down as it dries - rolling over it too much causes it to lay less and get \\""rocky\\"", IMO. About it being too hot to walk on - I can't really say much on that yet b/c it has been relatively cool in our area for this time of the year. What I can say is this - we have 2 decks - the pool deck is composite and the larger deck is PT. Before Restore both decking materials got extremely hot in the direct sun (with the composite being the worst). We put a few outdoor rugs down and problem solved. So, will the Restore get hot? I would imagine.<br /><br />TIPS: I used a roller grid that went right in the bucket vs a pan. Much easier IMO. I bought a $6 mixer and just left it in the bucket behind the roller grid - this allowed me to quickly attach the drill and mix if necessary (I did not have to mix that much - maybe twice per coat). I used a putty knife to scrape out the excess product that oozed in b/t the boards and scraped this on the next board I was going to do - no need to waste the product. Lightly re-roll to knock down where you scraped in b/t the boards - done.<br /><br />I've finished @ 1/3 of my deck (@200 sq-ft) with 2 coats - took me 6 hours to apply the thick stuff. So, I'm looking at another 12 tofinish the deck - but won't be surprised if it takes less time. The majority of my time invested in this project has been the prep work. Sure, putting the thick stuff down takes a little extra time but, if I'm being honest, once you find your rhythm it's easy to put down. So, if you're considering doing the Restore - don't let the negative reviews steer you away - just make sure you prep, follow the instructions and take your time. After all, if you're supposed to get 8-10 yrs out of it (gimme 5 years and I'll take it) - don't you think it might take a little longer to put down? Oh, and I never added any water. Good luck Restoring..."
4,Works really well.
1,it doesn't stay charge long enough to charge my phone. I wouldn't waste my time buying this product if I were you even though i bought it already........... I'm trying to save you some money here.
5,"Great, lightweight tool for backpacking."
5,"I am replacing an older USB single-band interface.<br /><br />This one was fast to set up, easy to program and communicates more reliably with all my devices (wired and wireless).<br /><br />Most importantly, and I didn't realize this was an issue before switching to this model: it is much faster than the other interface. This may be completely false, but it seems MUCH snappier. Very happy with this purchase!"
5,Perfect!
3,"Not the best motion sensor, but you cannot beat the price. This has 2 options for the outlet. One will make the outlet work for a light which will only come on when room is dark and you walk in. But if the room has natural light and you walk in this will not turn the outlet on. Motion sensor for me works only part time and I need it for light. Some times I'll step a foot the the room and it will turn on. Others I walk halfway through the room and flap my arms before it comes on. Also had to change the fuse after 2 weeks of use"
5,this will be good for anyone who is walking their dogs.<br />great for camping trips. The light is bright. 5 stars.
4,"Pros.<br />Easy to install, Honeywell provides multiple videos to hook this up regardless if you have a C-wire or not they have a video for you.<br />Easy to connect to with wifi, If you can connect your phone to wifi, or a laptop you will have no problems connecting this.<br />Provides outdoor weather update pulled from internet.<br />Full color gradient.<br /><br />Cons.<br />Voice recognition is not as great as I like. I need to be within about 20 feet and can not have high amount of ambient noise.<br />The wire inputs are split to each side making it a little more difficult to get wires in, and tucked away.<br />The screws should have came with washers, the head of the provided screw will almost go through the screw slots. Especially if you over-tighten attempting to get flush against wall.<br /><br />Note:<br />The Item is smaller than it appears, double check dimensions. I would also advise buyer to check their C-wire condition. (Do you have one? If no do you have the tools and means to add one, or use an existing wire if needed.)"
1,"Like others have stated, it may or may not turn on or off at the time selected. I set it to turn on and turn off three hours later. I was not around when it turned on, but I assume that it did so correctly. I returned six hours later and it was still running. It did not turn off in three hours as programed. The &#34;off&#34; pin did move the switch about 3/4 of the way to the &#34;off&#34; position, but not far enough to turn the connected device off. Unfortunately I waited too long to return the item. It seemed to work the first time I used it, but failed the next usage after the return period."
4,"The only glitch with this item is the tendency to enter test mode occasionally when you turn on a compact fluorescent light bulb near it. Apparently, the bulb triggers the TV Remote based testing function. A quick call to their support line later and they gave me the instructions to turn off that functionality. No more problems. Didn't get full stars ONLY because of the stress it caused before we figured out WHY it was going off. Other than that small issue, it seems to do it's job extremely well."
5,"This is much better quality than I've bought elsewhere. The element is full - rounded, not the flat kind."
5,"Great fit.,trim to size"
1,"This unit is a CDN freezer alarm, not a whirlpool. It can be found for 7-8 dollars from other amazon companies."
5,"This is really a great product!! I am paralyzed and my hands are limited in gripping and spraying.I bought this to help me painting my models and dioramas.I must say,if you haveany kind of limits with your hands or not this is the greatest product I have ever used for spray painting my models and dioramas.Very little squeeze pressure needed,no kidding.Also the price of this is very little compared to what it helps me to do with my hands.GREAT PRODUCT!!!"
5,"Quick shipping, works great!"
5,very sturdy
5,"This tool did a great job keeping dust from circulating around my house when I was working on a large drywall project. I started the project before I had this tool, and the room was just one big dust cloud during sanding. I bought this tool and a cheap 3 HP shop-vac and it made everything much more simple. You will still want to protect your floors and furniture as some dust will still escape the vacuum, but after working using this tool, the air was still clear and I wasn't covered in dust.<br /><br />If you're doing a ceiling or high wall, I'd suggest looking for the version of this you can attach to a pole to make it a little easier."
5,"This is my favorite weekly hair treatment/mask. It leaves my hair so soft, I can't stop touching and running my fingers through it. It has a clean, minty/herbal scent that is so relaxing in the shower/bath. And the scent is completely unisex--it's neither too feminine or too masculine. I even prefer this to Ojon Restorative Hair Treatment."
5,I purchased three of these valves to eventually replace the ones that my home was built with (the old gate valve-style valves with a plastic ferrule). These look decent and will add an updated look to the toilet shut-offs.
5,"Good item, I had never used Water based before, it was very easy to apply."
5,"I've bought Samsung at far greater price and these. I've owned the refrigerator 3 years now. NONE last 6 months-as they say-and since there is only one person in my household-me-think more people would last shorter. The price of the Samsung, which was all that was available since I bought when they first came out, is so high. These work just as well and cost far less. Now make your own decision, I've made mine as this is 3rd time I've purchased 2 at a time."
5,These body seems to seal against the bulb so water doesn't creep in to the electrical connection. The loops on either side are perfect for running a small zip tie through to connect these to rope or metal cable for stretching longer distances or for permanent installation. I have had these installed over my patio for past 8 months without any bulbs burning out and dimmer operation is excellent which adds a great feeling of an artifical ceiling and plenty of light coverage. These look alot better than the green base type that are like christmas lights and seem to have thick insulation so will hopefully hold up for many years.
4,"We have been using various faucet mounts filters for years. I finally got tired of dealing with overpriced replacement filters, so I finally decided to go under the sink.. My main concern is the weak point. namely the plastic handle. I'm usually careful with what I see as the weakest link to any product, I can see where with many customers, this might be a issue."
3,"our drop in cabinet needed slight modification to accommodate the securing screws on the corners, but otherwise it is working out well."
4,Looks great on the wall. Not as good as other decal sellers due to it being a clear stick on that will show up when the sun is shining on it. Also is kind of a pain putting it up and make it all align perfectly due to it being so many separate and small pieces. Looks cool though!
5,"Works well for my shed. Didn't want to worry about having a key with me when working outside, and this was exactly the ticket!"
4,"These color-changing &#34;animals&#34; with the LED light inside are very pretty. I wish they were a little bigger, and unless you are nearly &#34;standing on top of&#34; them, you can't really tell what they are. The do add interest and color to an otherwise relatively blue landscape of lights. VERY pretty; easy to set up, and easy to get going. I like them, but more importantly, my spouse likes them. So, that's a plus."
5,Saved me hundreds in repair bills.
4,"Needing 50 handles, I was having a difficult time finding something I liked for a reasonable price. I love that these were available in a 25 pack! Unfortunately, one handle was missing from one of my packs, which Amazon handled wonderfully, and one handle had a chip in it. I put the chipped one a high, less-used cabinet. Overall, the handles are a nice weight, color, and value, and they really helped update the look of my kitchen."
5,works really well with vera edge
4,"hi I like this faucet, you can switch from stream to spray however I wish it had a hold one so I could move it around more but it is a nice faucet and love the price"
5,I love incandescent lighting & Reveal incandescent is the best of the best. Flourescent & some LEDs stress me out.
5,"This is the best wireless door bell I have seen to date. It has more the adequate volume, is easy to set up and is very good quality. A great Honeywell product. Well worth the money."
5,Good stuff!
5,So glad that I found these! They are the real thing without the price tag! These clean really well and don't seem to fall apart as fast as mr. Clean scrubbers do. The price can not be beat. Will definitely order again.
5,"You can almost hear your furniture slurp this us. It puts a great shine on wood, and makes me feel so much better about the health of my wood as I live in Phoenix which just dries everything out! Love the shine it leaves."
4,"Part works fine. Only problem was that the wires were too short and needed to be spliced in. Otherwise, installation was relatively easy."
5,The Chandelier was easy to install. Everything was packed well protected. The picture on line did not do the actually beauty of the chandelier justice. Above all the price was the lowest of all the venues I had gone through prior to my purchase. Compliments from family and friends are plentiful!
5,love it
5,"Small, compact yet very bright. Bought these for the car and a scope room. The illumination that comes out of these compact flashlights is superb."
5,Bright bulb in a small size. Fit every fixture in my house
5,Good for your washing machines like front loaders that are notorious for smell . This helps considerably.
5,HOLY !!! This is it I finally found a shower head that is really high powers. THIS IS THE 4 hole one they have a six also. But more holes mean less pressure .so I opted for this one. I hooked it up and man really powerful on my low flow apt water.Then I read to take out the mandatory water restricters. ONE ARTICAL SAID TO JUST OPEN OR LOOK INTO THE NECK BALL JOINT AREA OF WHERE YOU SCREW THE SHOWER HEAD ON.AND TAKE OUT THE TINY BLACK RUBBER O RING. NEED A LONG NEEDLE TO PRICK OUT THE O RING . PRETTY EASY BUT LITTLE.THEN I PUT BACK ON. HOLY !!! Again it at least doubled the pressure on a ALREADY great head..it will knock you over almost. I love it.So don't drill out or mess with the white plastic built in flow part: leave it in. only take the black o RING out. if you mess with that part it can and will mess up break. the best shower headyou ever got. Get two there that good. SEEYA off to the shower....
3,cannot reorder
5,Great device for the money. May purchase another.
4,"I have a number of Sentry Safes, they are fireproof for a length of time and this is the first one I've bought that is also waterproof, another nice feature. Their locks are make for locking, they're not real tamperproof, as I found when I lost the keys for my 1170 model and we were able to pick the lock within several minutes. In case you happen to have an 1170, this one opens a bit differently. With the 1170, you put the key in, turn it and can pick up the lid. With the H4300SG, after you unlock it, you have to press down on the lid while gripping and pulling up the lid at the same time. This probably serves the purpose whereas if the safe is unlocked and knocked over, the lid won't flop pen and possibly let items fall out. If you deal with something like bad arthritis in your hands, you might find opening the H4300SG a bit difficult. The Sentry safes do serve their purpose at a reasonable price; they don't take the place of a safe deposit box. The one I bought from Amazon was in \\""used - like new\\"" condition, I saved money on it going this route. The condition was as advertised and I'm happy with the purchase."
5,Works exactly how it's supposed to. I have mine in the kitchen for all my appliances and it's great because I can have everything flush with the wall and not all tangled up and in the way.
1,"These lamps are not &#34;blood orange&#34; as noted. To me, blood orange is a red/orange color and they appear that way online. They are actually a lighter orange. Even the tag on the lamp describes the color as orange so I'm not sure why Amazon has Blood Orange written on their website description. I've had great experience with Amazon so I figured no big deal, I'll return them. I can't return the lamps! Amazon is telling me they are not eligible for a return. No where was that stated on the website when I initially placed my order. I even went ahead and placed the lamps in my cart again to see if I missed some fine print. (Which it shouldn't be in fine print anyways) and I was correct. No where does it say that the item cannot be returned. I am hoping they can fix this situation as I wait on hold...."
5,These bulbs are what their description say they are.
5,"Arrived well before quoted arrival date, purchased item worked perfectly. I would have no problem recommending this seller and product."
5,"A good tack cloth, better than the generic Lowes cloth. They are a heavier fabric that is easier to unfold and each has more surface area. For little more expense they are worth the cost"
5,"Great brush, perfect for corners, tight spots, ceiling detail, etc. I really enjoyed it and the triangle shape also cuts down on hand cramps when using it."
5,I like it. It's durable and should remain flexible throughout the extreme cold of our Wyoming winters. Good quality wire. I also purchased the 12/3 and am very pleased.
5,So far so good. Nice and bright and lights up quick. The fluourescent lights take so much time to get fully lite up so we are enjoying the LED fixtures. Will be getting more LED lights to continue to upgrade our home. Highly recommend this fixture.
4,Good quality but shipping delay!
4,"Not quite as bright as I expected, but this is a very tidy and contemporary look for my stainless and modern kitchen area. Thinking about ordering another."
5,nice looking hardware for 1/2 the price vs the local surplus shop jazzed up the new cabinets.
5,It was a present for my daughters BD. She loved it.....so did I. It is a pleasure to get something right
5,"Very simple, so there is not much to day.<br />It works, and seems solid."
3,"Buy this thermostat guard if you have the lever type thermostat that can be manipulated with paper clips (or the like) through the vents of other guards. Otherwise, you're better off with a honeywell type.<br /><br />I have 2 beefs with it:<br /><br />1 - the screw mount holes are not symmetrically aligned in the box. I suppose it's minor, but since there's no reason for it, it just smacks of cheap.<br /><br />2 - It's basically half of a cylinder, so at its apex, it sticks out from the wall quite a bit.<br />."
5,Just make putting up long runs of crown molding simple and a one man job. That is worth ten stars.
5,LOVE IT!!
1,"There should be a CLEAR warning on this tape to use ONLY on surfaces that haven't been treated (paint, resin, etc.). The man at Home Depot said the green tape is pretty much the same as the blue, but it isn't!!! I spent dozens of hours creating my bathroom mosaic vanity top, and now parts of the gorgeous resin finish are blotchy. I've used the blue tape for painting and haven't had any trouble with leakage, as long as I press carefully and firmly around all the edges."
1,"this company used the picture of the reputable company which has dependable lanterns. These lanterns tore so easily that almost all of them tore and therefore wouldn't function properly. The ones that did not tear, the fuel would fall off so it would not fill with air. They are misrepresenting themselves with the White Skylantern Company"
1,"It does not poke a whole in the bottom of kcups, this is useless. DO NOT BUY!!!"
5,This works well to keep the heat in and is lowering our heating bill
5,"The power goes off in the middle of the night and you are left to fumble for a flashlight in a drawer - if you have one. Or, you need to get up and walk to the bathroom or anywhere and need a readily available flashlight. This is HIPE's newest multi-function light and it's so easy to use.<br /><br />The unit is a tray that plugs into the wall socket and the flashlight sits in the well - charging (simple induction). It has a three-prong plug, but this can be rotated at 90-degrees to fit the situation. The tray has a "" thick LED blue light that stays on for a permanent nightlight. You can set the unit to ON, OFF or AUTO. The bottom switch is not labeled well, so you need to experiment a bit.<br /><br />In the middle of the night, if the power goes off, the Light automatically lights up. The six (6) bluish LED lights are very bright and will illuminate the room easily. The button on the side will light the flashlight with one press. A second press will put it into strobe mode. A third press turns it off. I would suggest placing this near your bed for convenience.<br /><br />When there is a black-out, the HIPE light will stay on until power is restored. I have not experienced this yet with my unit, but the idea of it not turning off means it will drain down. When you are done, simply switch the button to OFF. This will start to recharge when power goes back on. Because it is powered by an internal Lithium Ion battery, you never need replacement batteries. Remember those heavy flashlights with the Size 'D' batteries? Those are history and when you compare the price of this light to any ordinary flashlight, you'll wonder what took this invention so long to arrive.<br /><br />Like all of HIPE products, they are environmentally friendly. This unit was generously supplied to me for an honest review."
5,"I want to say up front that I had a marvelous experience with tech support. Rosemary V. was very attentiveness and had a genuine desire to assist the customer. I am happy with my new Skybell wi-fi video doorbell 2.0. The security/mounting screw on the bottom of the device took a little work (the screw was the only sticking point), and I had to switch my Linksys 5 ghz router to a dual-band (2.4 ghz & 5ghz), because skybell would only function with the 2.4 ghz band. As I was resolving the band issue, my doorbell chime still worked with Skybell mounted and before it was fully functional. Skybell works well with my Samsung Galaxy s6 Edge. I am now enjoying the functionality I read about as I researched online before my purchase. Rosemary V, thanks for your expertise and professional demeanor."
5,"Update: customer service from Westinghouse is great. I wrote to them and someone actually called to troubleshoot the problem I was having. After going back and forth the tech finally determined that the receiver unit is defective... And he was right. Fan and remote both work flawlessly now. I'm a happy camper and westinghouse won another customer over with their service!<br /><br />------------------------------------<br />Fan is a little smaller than expected but it looks great and works without any issues.<br /><br />Originally I ordered a generic ceiling fan remote for this fan and that works without any issues. However, the original Westinghouse remote control is more attractive (I have another fan that came with the remote) so I went ahead and ordered another one for this. However, after connecting all the wires, the fan works but the light doesn't. It does not turn the light on nor does it dim the light.<br /><br />It's frustrating that a generic and much cheaper remote control works without any issues but the genuine Westinghouse remote that I paid more than twice for doesn't control all the functions on a Westinghouse fan."
5,"Well made mostly metal, quiet and easy to install"
5,Perfect fit and works fine. No problems at all.
5,I love these lights! Outstanding perfect light. Great value!
2,"The bell-shaped shower head retains water after cutoff then drips for hours until it is empty. Since I am concerned about hard water stains on the newly tiled shower floor, I must resort to holding my fingers on the head after use until all the water syphons out. This is a nuisance and is certainly unreasonable given the high cost of this hardware."
5,"Arrived quick and easy to install, once you have access to the under side of the washer (or take the time to remove the top and front). Granted I had some practice, once to diagnose the problem and then then again after the part arrived 3 days later. Watch a few YouTube instructions for courage."
1,"I ordered the Cooper Lighting N150NHCI 150-Watt High Pressure Sodium Industrial Grade Dusk to Dawn Security Area Light.I was sent a econolite instead, so it was returned. I only accept, products, which I order!! I feel like I was being taken advantage of!"
3,difficult to install and put all the glass on
2,"I have to send it back, as there is nothing in the listing that explains it does not dry clear, or it does dry a color...I needed clear, and took for granted that it would be a clear epoxy...These things should be mentioned in the description...please"
2,"This light bulb is very dim and doesn't illuminate much. Now, I wanted to use it as my room light bulb, so maybe that's why I wasn't happy with it. Maybe if you're only looking to insert it in some lame night-lamp, it may work out for you. Your choice. Thanks for reading this review."
5,"Excellent product, superior packaging, quick delivery. I look forward to hanging pictures in my new office with a few of the picture hangers!"
5,"I had a basic-model Speakman in the 1990s. It was all brass, solid as a rock, simple in design and function, and probably cost about $30 at the time I purchased it. The thing would probably be still working for me, but I tossed it into garage storage when I remodeled the bathroom, and opted for a high-priced, oh-so-fancy, multi-jet shower head from a company I won't mention. When that supposedly indestructible shower head needed to be replaced due to water streaming out the side seam (!), I looked around for my old Speakman. Gone. Probably donated to Goodwill by accident. So I went online and looked for a basic Speakman. Plastic! They are all plastic now. Then I saw this baby, and I was smitten. Old-school quality, even if it does come at a new-age price. I am pleased as can be after installing and using it. The overall design could not be cleaner, the chrome plating is thick and has a gorgeous gloss, the handle moves smoothly and evenly to move through the range of flow. I love the fine spray for most washing, while the &#34;pour&#34; setting is great for rinsing hair. No snazzy bells and whistles here, just a good, solid shower head that should last many years.<br /><br />I think the reviewers complaining of inadequate water pressure may be talking about low water volume, which is a different issue. The strength of the spray this provides is quite good for a low-flow unit. I live in California, where every drop counts.<br /><br />(One nice little detail is that Speakman provides the pipe tape necessary for installation, so don't buy any here, as I did.)"
5,"These magnets are great but are very tiny as you can see in the picture! If you are looking for a strong, small magnet, they are great! But, beware if you are worried about animals or kids swallowing the powerful magnets."
3,"This GE Dimmer, Light Socket Indoor with Light Level Control Knob, White 55431 is used with a regular incandescent light socket to all lights to be dimmed. I makes the normal bulb too long for some lamps and it may be necessary for the user to modify the shade holder or the lamp to access the twist dimmer or to fit in your lamp. Be aware it is awkward to use, in some application where your hand has to slide in along side the bulb."
2,Broke to easily on a windy day. Had to buy a metal version. If you live where it might get windy don't buy this. Otherwise it seemed ok.
5,"I love this lighting system. It makes me giggle because I had two men (an electrician and my husband) tell me that I couldn't have what I wanted for under cabinet lighting and this system gave it to me with the least amount of work and destruction. I wanted a regular light switch to turn them on (one on each side of the room was acceptable), and despite one side of cabinets being broken up by a window, I wanted those to come on with one switch too. The problem is that I have a two story house. They said that holes would need to be punched through the ceiling and the electrician said that we'd need to be concerned about the total load. Fortunately we were making this decision before tiling the back splash so we were able to run the connection, under the window and behind the wall, without any major destruction.<br /><br />One piece of advice I'd offer is to be certain you know whether you want the cool bright light system or the warm lights. Newer appliances, like my exhaust hood, use the brighter blue light leds and the lights we've all been using in our homes are more like the \\""warm\\"" lights. If you mix lights, chances are that the difference will scream out at you, and/or the \\""bright\\"" lights will feel too harsh.<br /><br />I should probably tell you that I purchased this same system through their online store. We needed additional pieces that this kit doesn't include and so it made more sense to buy it direct. We had to run one wire behind the wall for the cabinets separate by a window and the company offers that wire on their site. However, I did buy additional connectors through Amazon. It might be helpful to know that the website has videos that were very helpful in aiding us with our decisions, as well as helping us know what to expect. IMO, this company is tops for those looking to update lighting with ease, at a reasonable price that is actually relatively inexpensive when compared to others."
5,Great Product !! And quick Delivery !!
1,when apleyd it was to bubely<br />i found better for cheaper at the harde ware store [ spray on gutter repair ] in roofing
3,Be very careful with what you use to clean these with. Mild cleaners only or the nickel coating will peel off in pieces. We had 3 out of 5 fall apart because a maid used a regular bathroom cleaner. We were not told by the contractor to use simple soap & hot water. As a result we are paying $350 to replace them. The factory sent 3 wrong replacements when first alerted & now tells us tough luck. GO ELsewhere for a better product. All of them work well some hold up better than others. This happened within 3 months.
1,The faucet set I received had been sent and returned previously and witnessed by the notes and phone numbers hand written on the instruction sheet. It was defective mainly due to a casting flaw on the main valve assembly. I was forced to purchase another locally to complete the job on time. Amazon did resolve the problem rapidly and to my satisfaction.
5,All the batteries!! Great price :)
1,We bought this faucet and within a couple months the finish comes off! Looks awful and we're looking for a new faucet to replace this one. Not worth the money.
5,Bought these to replace some defective 10mm green LED's on some par cans I purchased. Worked great and now I have 98 spares.
5,"Using it for 11 months. Noise mentioned in the reviews yet to come. Not rust formation, so far a very sturdy product. Initially it felt weird to have lower water flow. 5 person family with visitors over the summer and holidays. Appeared to save ~ 4000 - 5000 gallons of water. Please note I did not have an accurate control to say for sure this shower head saved that amount of water. It is an educated extrapolation of 8 yrs worth of water bills"
5,this disposal is not only quiet but very efficient. you pay what you get for. it may be a little more $$ but well worth it.
5,"It takes a little getting used to , but this is a great faucet."
5,"There's not much to say about this but I want to get the ratings done, so I'm just saying these plastic pipettes are what you expect."
4,"We don't use it in the shower, but it is in our bathroom.  Volume is loud and clear and reception is great.  I really like the portability of the unit as well.  I would buy this again."
5,Great deal! I have got what I have expected. The speaker sounds really good and it is easy to work with it
5,50 foot High Speed HDMI Cable:  The cable was as advertised and have had no problems with it. I would tell others it is a good buy.
5,I'm very pleased with this speaker dock. The sound is full and not tinny like a lot of the other docks out there. As others have reported it can be as loud as any reasonable person would want. My Zune 120 fits perfectly and the remote works well. I had read reviews that knocked the Kicker for not having an FM receiver but you can play FM through the speakers with the Zune- just leave the headphones attached because they act as an antenna. Bottom line: it sounds terrific and works the way it is supposed to.
5,I have a difficult hearing and these help a lot
5,Great fast delivery and good product!
5,I purchased this together with a flat screen wall mount as part of a living room remodel. Our contractor indicated it was easy to install. It's great for hiding the cables.
1,"I bought this less then a month ago and my TV doesn't work again - same issue, the lamp. How can I get a new one under the 90 day warranty?"
1,I thought this would be the best gift and it was until the person went to use them and they didn't work at all not a sound at all
4,They say it's 8.5 watts I don't think so.ive had this apart it has 2  2 watt speakers.if it were 8.5 watts the 2 watt speakers would blow due to over wattage and distortion.  does sound pretty good for the price.i just got it for the little amp inside
4,"I almost never buy a product which doesn't have a decent review written about it anywhere online, but I decided to take a chance with these cans.  Briefly, the noise cancelling works extremely well, they're comfortable, and they fold up into a very small package for being over the ear phones (with my ears, anyways).  That said, I was very disappointed with the sound quality when the noise cancelling was turned off, although when turned on they sound really good on the low end, even if the highs are somewhat muted.  My only concern at this point is how long the batteries will last since there's no way I'm going to use these without the noise cancelling turned on."
5,This product works as well as any other HDMI Cables I've used and I have nothing bad to say about the product.  I've been very satisfied with the performance and durability.
5,"Just got it.  So far, so good.  My 13-year old daughter loves it.  Sound is actually pretty good.  Very easy to sync with iPhone 4s.  Controls all work well.  I'm happy I bought it.  I was a little surprised, though, about the size.  It's bigger than I thought it would be.  A little too big to be &#34;travel size&#34;, at least in my opinion.  But fits in the shower well, not obtrusive."
5,"Received this replacement battery for my rechargeable lantern yesterday.  Had time today to install it and had a little bit of charge and it worked.  Lantern is handy and was thankful there was a replacement.  Shipping was excellent and cannot think of anything negative about this product.  If anyone is interested, this battery has push in terminals like what you can find on ur car."
5,"As an IT professional, I was very skeptical that this antenna actually does what it says based upon the flimsy appearance of the product. I put this bad boy high up on the wall and it pulled in 17 local channels without any trouble! I'm guessing most people are not willing to put this high up enough on the wall to get a proper signal which I'm guessing is where a majority of the negative reviews are coming from. It is very impressive for a non powered antenna to pull in this many local stations! Do not hesitate to buy this antenna!"
5,great buy
5,The product was ordered and 3 day later I had it installed and reattached to my system.  A good price and great shipping response.  A good deal all around.
5,Love this remote
5,"It works great when you pair with apple TV. Since I have given my original apple TV remote to my son, I have to download REMOTE APP on iphone and followed apple directions to operate the Remote App on my iphone 6. It works like a charm. Using this app, I could control my apple TV with ease. Great app. Using this app as remote, I paired this Audiovox remote to apple TV. To my great surprise, this Audiovox  remote works like a charm. This Audiovox remote is great for elderly because they can see all the buttons on remote with ease."
4,Necessary  to keep your outside solar lights working properly
5,These are sweet surround speakers; I use them as my rear speakers and they are very nice. Polk is a good value and I also own their 12&#34; woofer and center channel speakers.
5,"Product seems to be as advertised.  I've only used one battery so far, but it worked as you would expect."
5,"I've been looking for some headphones to run with for a while and I've tried several different models.  Many haven't stayed put and others made a lot of noise through the cord (e.g., BOOM BOOM transferred through the cord with each step).  The PMX70 is great!  The sound is superb and they stay put."
4,"I ordered this radio from the World Net Daily Web-store. I had recently signed up to receive their email updates and as a thank-you bonus I was awarded a 50% off discount code.  I decided to purchase this Kaito 500 radio.  The price I paid was $30.35 and that included shipping.  I ordered it on Saturday evening and received it the following Friday morning.  The radio was packaged well and when I opened the box I was happy to realize it had been delivered in excellent condition.  After plugging the rechargeable battery in per instructions, and cranking the dymo for 1 minute, it powered right up and I was able to tune to my favorite AM station.  Although the speaker is small the sound was excellent at a fairly low volume.  I flipped to the FM band and that all sounded good too.  I haven't tried either SW bands yet but will test those at night.  I tested the flashlight and reading light function. Both worked without flaw. I was able to pick up the weather band on channel 1 but it did not pull that broadcast in nearly as good as a smaller weather radio that I have so the weather radio of the Kaito 500 could be much better.  The radio comes with various charging cables for cell phones etc.  I have not tested this function yet.  So far I rate this radio a 4 out of 5 stars due to the weather radio reception issue.  I have no serious complaints especially for the price I paid."
3,"I purchased this mount because I wanted to mount my Samsung 63\\"" [[ASIN:B003A7X5HU Samsung PN63C8000 63-Inch 1080p 3D Plasma HDTV, Black]] as close to the wall as possible, and this seemed to be the lowest mount available with the exception of the Samsung picture frame style mount, but that mount was over $200 and I had qualms about the stability of that mount (just mounts into the drywall - no thanks).<br /><br />I had read some of the negative reviews about this ultra low profile mount where users had a problem with having room for wires.  On my Samsung, the inputs are oriented towards the side of the TV, so I figured I'd have plenty of room for wires.<br /><br />Installation wasn't too difficult, but the included instructions were pretty bad.  I didn't find out until after installing that they have a video instruction on the Sanus website - I highly recommend viewing before installation.  One thing to make sure you do before mounting the TV, is make sure you adjust the strings behind the TV so they hang down low enough (almost as low as the bottom of the TV) that you can reach them.  You will need to pull these strings to make adjustments, plug in your inputs, or remove the mount later - so neglecting to adjust the strings prior to mounting, as I did on my first pass, can leave a major headache (I was able to fish them from behind the TV, and I removed the TV from the mount and adjusted the wires correctly and remounted ... again, had I watched the video I wouldn't have made this mistake in the first place).<br /><br />So why 3 stars?  Well I have a couple of problems with this mount.  The bracket that attaches to the TV grips the top of the wall mount, then is supposed to \\""click\\"" into place at the bottom in order to form a secure mount.  Problem is, if there is anything back there at all blocking the TV, it won't click into place.  This is the problem some of the negative reviewers who have TVs with inputs facing backwards have - it didn't leave any room for the HDMI or other input cables.  In my case, my cables are perpendicular to the TV and don't seem to be the problem.  What's even worse than the lack of clicking, is my TV isn't quite flat against the wall - the front of the TV is a little under 2\\"" from the wall on the left side, and a little over 2\\"" from the wall on the right side, for a difference of over half an inch.  I think my culprit might be, the wall I have it mounted on is in a spot where an exterior concrete block wall meets an interior wall, with a sheet of drywall over the interior and the drywall has a very very slight (barely noticeable, and in fact not noticeable at all had I never tried to mount this to it) bulge to it.  I think that very slight roundness is what is causing my problems with this mount.  Yes, I realize this is mostly my own problem as I don't have a perfectly smooth mounting surface - but my point is, this \\""ultra slim\\"" mount by leaving only .55\\"" inches behind the TV leaves you almost no room for error.  If there is any obstruction, including wires or anything else, you could have problems.<br /><br />Other than that, the quality of this product is pretty good.  The one week spot I would point out, and I haven't tested it for failure, but the mechanism where you pull the strings to release the lock seems pretty flimsy.  If this mechanism were to fail, you would potentially find it extremely difficult to remove the TV from the wall.  And again, with the extremely low profile of the mount at only .55\\"", you'd have very few options to get back there and try to get the thing loose.<br /><br />Overall, this isn't a terrible product, but I have to recommend it with reservations.  If, like most TVs, the inputs on your TV face backwards requiring some room for wires, I would look for a mount that isn't quite so close to the wall.  Similarly, if your wall is anything but perfectly flat and smooth (get up with your eye next to your wall and look, the imperfection I'm talking about is not noticeableotherwise), this mount could give you problems.  On top of that, the flimsy string mechanism would worry me a little bit as well.  Finally, if your setup can accommodate an ultra low profile mount and you do decide to buy this product, make sure to watch the installation video on the Sanus website, and if installing into concrete, I'd go out and buy better anchors than what comes with this mount.<br /><br />3 Stars.  Under perfect conditions it probably works fine and it does get the TV nice and close to the wall, but frankly I wish I'd just bought a less low profile mount to start with - it would end up looking just as good with much less hassle.  I will probably replace this mount with one that has a little more forgiveness, likely one of the cheaper Amazon Basics models that get good reviews.oblems.

5,I really like it. Good sound.
3,"I received these headphone straight from Flips audio themselves, I took there try before you buy challenge. I used them over a couple of weeks to them an honest try. I used them as headphones and also used the unique feature and as the name suggests the ear cups flip out 180 degrees to act as powered amplified portable speakers.<br /><br />Here is the break down of the head phones.<br /><br />Presentation.<br />  The overall presentation of the headphones are very nice from the sleek packaging  stating all the aspects of the headphones to the ample amounts of padding used to secure the headphones themselves. The headphones themselves are stored inside a semi hard shell. The. Hard shell itself Is  more of an egg shape to accommodate the headphones in their folded positions. Inside the case comes the headphones in their folded position and a USB charging cable to charge the battery that is used when the headphones are used in the flipped out speaker position.<br /><br />Build quality<br />  The overall build quality of the headphones are a mixed bag. Some parts are built for use and abuse, like the sturdy metal hinges that are used when folding the phones to store them. While other parts seem just a little too weak for the job at hand. Ie. the  pivot points of the actual ear cups have a very slight wobble when you flip out the ear cups to use as head phones. I do not know if they are designed that way or not. Also the headphones are a tight fit, after using them for an extended time the pressure of the head phone can be felt on the temples, even more so if you use glasses.<br /><br />Sound quality<br /><br />  The sound of the headphones are good but not great. The sound range of the headphones seem to be somewhat limited are a bit flat. Mind you all of the sounds are their  and can be heard. But the overall mix of the speakers seems to limit what these speakers are actually capable of doing.On the up side they do sound much better when they are flipped out and  usedas powered speakers.<br /><br />Overall<br /><br />These headphones are descent headphones. But there are a few nuances That seems to keep these headphones from being great. I.e. the tight fit and the limited soundscape of the earphones keep these head phones from being a great pair.<br /><br />I hope this honest review of these head phones help the maker consider some minor changes to these to make these head phones a great pair.<br /><br />But as with all reviews it is up to you to come up with your own conclusion."
4,A good bluetooth just very loose when moving around
5,Excellent experience on this order.
3,Okay. Still weak atenna.
1,"For safety sake while driving, all bluetooth headsets should have a button that activates the phone for calling or connecting to Siri. Incredibly, these beautiful headphones do not have this feature. True, to answer a call, you can press the volume knob in, and it seems that if you press it twice it dials the last call you messaged or called, but there is no way to communicate to the phone. You have to use your mobile device, scroll through your contact list ....take your eyes off the road ....very disappointing."
5,"Used this mount for a 32&#34; Panasonic flat panel - may be a bit overkill, but I will never have to worry that it will fail.  Tucks in nicely behind the TV and allows for easy adjustment.  Highly recommend!"
1,"Worked great for a couple of weeks but now the firm ware quit working. This product is now not supported by Creative any more!<br /><br />First Amazon product to not work, all other products have been GREAT."
4,Love the sound quality but pairing instructions lacking details
5,Great value!  Identical to those costing $80+ on &#34;audiophile&#34; sites!
1,NOT DEEP FRINGE AT ALL!!  This antenna can't receive reception at 50 miles.  One company said the HG-997 could receive reception at one hundred fifty miles.  No WAY!!!
5,There were a number of bad reviews of cheaper parts. I opted to spend a little more and had no problems installing it.
5,Good
5,Fits my Bose earphones perfectly.
5,"So far, so good.  The battery fit fine and connected fine.  We had a power outage today, and it appeared to work fine as well."
1,The product does not work properly.  We can only get one radio station on radio.  I am sending it back.  Bernadette Bradley
5,"Hard to go by headset. Wished sony would still manufacture these, because their alternative is lacking.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good battery life.<br />Excellent sound quality.<br />Nice range, I am able to freely roam the office, from my cubicle to the water thank, to the kitchen and still play music from my laptop.<br />Leather ear cups, and good enough noise suppression to be used on an airplane.<br />Excellent price.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />You can't use them while they charge up."
1,I got two different cords and none off them work
1,"I bought the cable and for starters they sent the wrong length. Upon finally receiving the correct length, I found it to be a shoddy cable that would have channels cut in and out despite all of my efforts of twisting, bending, etc., when inserting into my laptop.<br /><br />Yes, typical headphones work fine in my laptop. The cable was entirely at fault, and is now in the dumpster."
4,"It sounds good, for the price, but it was a bit tight on my head.  I have used the mic feature and it also works well."
5,Third time is the charm.  This is the third pair of this type that I purchased for my wife and she loves these and finds them easy to wear.
5,"We had used a Sound and Lights monitor for our first child, but when the baby came along and we needed a second monitor, I chose this one because of the many channels.  I wanted to make sure that there wouldn't be interference with our first monitor.  The difference between the two monitors is overwhelming!  This monitor does not make popping/crackling noises, or that odd bounding noise that my sounds and lights monitor does.  In addition, the monitor really picks up the baby sounds well and makes them stand out over the background noise.  We play a white noise machine (washing machine noise) and the noise cancelling feature does not eliminate this as background noise- however, it does minimize the sound in comparison to the babies noise in both modes.  I cannot begin to say how wonderful the lack of static etc is, not to mention the choice of 27 channels! My only complaint is that using this monitor has made me supremely dissatisfied with my older monitor- so I may have to buy a second Sony!"
3,"I just purchased these to replace my HD555s at work.  Aaaand - I just printed the return label.<br /><br />I love my 555s, but the open design is not ideal for a shared workspace.  There's substantial two-way leakage, meaning that, in order to block out my more obnoxious cube mates, I must jack up the volume...  in turn contributing to the general obnoxiousness!<br /><br />On the other hand, the 555s are the most comfortable pair of cans I've ever put on, and I can wear them for an entire day with minimal fatigue.  I've got some seriously sensitive ears, and even a bit of pressure or displacement becomes very uncomfortable quite quickly.<br /><br />Upon opening, I was immediately concerned with the slightly less space in the cups, and the leather-like padding material (in contrast to the 555's velour-y padding).  FWIW, I was aware of the leatherette cups at purchase, and thought I could probably live with it, (hoping they'd not be too sweat-inducing).  I had, however, purchased the 448s hoping that sticking with the brand would mean the same voluminous cups.  Alas, it proved not to be so.<br /><br />Along with the above concerns, I wasn't impressed with the build quality by comparison.  The whole kit was very plastic seeming and the cord was noticeably more flimsy than my triple-5 friends.<br /><br />I gave the 448s an hour.  I immediately noticed the outside attenuation, which was a good start, but also noticed a bit more pressure and less room in the cans.  Sound was good through the laptop -> E5.  Maybe a bit less transparent, but that was expected, and asked for.  I didn't experience major discomfort, but I was *aware* of them the entire time, and thinking about how long it would be until I was going to experience cumulative discomfort.<br /><br />Then the decisive moment - I put the 555s on to compare.  Ahhhhhh.  Little fluffy clouds.<br /><br />Take note, Herr/Fraulein Sennheiser - closed version of the 555/558/595 design will be in my shopping cart the moment I am aware of such a product.<br /><br />So, back go the 448s, sadly, and obnoxious co-workers will continue to be battled with reciprocal obnoxious volume-raising.  Extremely *comfortable* obnoxious reciprocity...<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0001FTVDQ Sennheiser  HD555 Professional Headphones with Sound Channeling]]sadly, and obnoxious co-workers will continue to be battled with reciprocal obnoxious volume-raising.

5,"Worked great! I needed this Active Adapter in order to be able to use three monitors at work with my Dell Precision M4700. I did not have monitors with display port so this fixed my problem. This adapter actually converts the DVI signal to Display Port signal. Something that normal adapters can't do. Best of all, I did not have to buy a new monitor :)"
5,good
4,Nice!
4,"Worked well for over a month, delivered the signal perfectly to my 1080p projector across the room. I wanted to reposition my projector, so I pulled out the cable, only the end remained stuck in the projector and I was sitting there with the cable in hand. I tried to put it back in place, but the amount of pins close to each other makes it impossible. You get what you pay for, it works, does the trick cheaply, but handle with care! Upgraded to 3 stars from 2 after a good RMA experience, despite it taking quite a while to get it back. Works again"
3,very quick delivery. One thing bothers me that it was supposed to in PHILIPS RETAIL BOX. It was not .I SENT A EMAIL. NO RESPONSE. LAMP IS WORKING FINE. BUT MY LAST REPLACEMENT LAMP BLEW OUT JUST AFTER SIX MO. NOT FROM SAME CO.  THEY ADVERTISE PHILIPS ORIGINAL LAMP. I HOPE THE EXPLANATION ASAP.
5,"I bought a pair last Christmas for a friend who LOVED them with his I-Pod Classic... I did a bunch of research before selecting them. This year, when I got my I-Pod Classic for Christmas I treated myself to a pair, and got another for the friend who gave me the I-Pod. They sound great. Full deep crisp sound.  There are 3 extra ear pieces to customize the fit from small to large ear canals.  LOVE the new case, rather than a hard case (like last year) there is a stylish flexible case you can stick in your pocket.  Very light weight almost noise canceling, my beagle cant hear what Im jamming to so no bleed.  You will love"
5,Exact replacement for my needs.
5,Great product
5,these little items do receive everything from all over the world.the price was cheap and they made excellent gifts.i received video from many countries that i had been to when i was in the navy.i still have two left.i keep those.these little things open up the whole world to you.they have no limits unless the country tv is not transmitting.amazon was selling them dirt cheap.everywhere else was overpriced.
5,I am very much impressed indeed with these in ear headphones.<br />I do love the sound and also its price from Amazon.<br />Excellent packaging!
5,It came fast works fine thank you
5,Quality of sound is a little tinny but not bad. Love the fit on my ears.
4,Had these less than a week.  Sounds really good especially for the price. ....most of all n they are super comfortable.
5,"Never had any problems with this item. I love it! The sound is great, it has plastic-coated buttons (easy to clean- just wipe), and even a magnetic remote! My mother has one, too. Neither of us can imagine the kitchen without our Sony cd radios. A built-in timer is easy to use, and the digital display is clear and easy to read. After trying two other under-the-cabinet models, I am so glad to have found this Sony. This is The One!"
4,"Great little speakers and heavy for the size which could indicate big magnets, is heard well over the top of 2 12 inch bass units and 2 12 inch mids, great rear suriubd speakers"
3,"Setup, input, and connection are as everyone has posted - Amazingly Easy. But the design of the remote buttons is terrible. Logitech needs to have one of their designers actually use the remote and then send everyone the newly designed remote with an apology for letting this one out the box. It's long design screams keeping the most used buttons together - which didn't happen. You can actually stretch a thumb ligament finding the info button. DVR-GUIDE-INFO need to be moved up to where the EXIT MENU buttons are. An analog PAGE UP PAGE DOWN rather than 'sketchy&#34; TOUCH SCREEN BUTTONS would add a flowing experience to the remote. I've owned Logitech mice, keyboards, and now this remote. And as the opening sentence shows, they're on the right track, just missed the bus with the layout."
5,"This radio really DOES pull in some distant stations! I haven't been able to listen to KDKA since 1960 (a good year to do it!)  I can finally pull in Cleveland's ESPN station, which is so low power you can't get it on most receivers."
3,Its okay sound is good up to the level of Sennheiser but one big disappointment was that it was incompatible with my Sony Xperia play.So no good sound on the goo for me used it with my pc works fine...
5,"I had been looking for a good sounding &#34;portable&#34; speaker. I must have seen about 20 different options. I started looking in the $200 USD range, obviously not the Marshall, but the reviews (i.e CNET) of such portable speakers would always make comparison to other better sounding speakers, including the Hanwell.<br />I am quite picky about sound.( I currently have a KEF home theater with a  Velodyne subwoofer. I have my own dj sound system with Gemini amplifiers, JBL standing speakers and Mackie sub, AT 50 MX headphones. You get the picture. I am a sound freak.) I am always trying to get a good sounding system for different purposes.<br />So what about my verdict? I used to play the Bose Sound Dock 10 and it sounded so good. Now we own the Bose Soundtouch 30. Bose is really capable of delivering good music devices. The Hanwell is something else.<br />I just got mine. It is not produced by the same Marshall guitar amplifier/speaker company in England but by Zound Industries in Stockholm for Marshall. This company also produces their Marshall headphones which have great reviews too. I am not sure what components they are using but they could be from SEAS, a Danish company nearby with excellent components. I will have to write Zound to confirm this.<br />The Marshall sound is really outstanding as a &#34;portable&#34; speaker, considering you can carry a 23 lb speaker. It is not a speaker you will take with you around town, but is &#34;portable&#34; around the house. I wanted it for an outside dinning terrace, and it's just perfect.<br />As it is a single enclosure it will not give you any type of sounstage, but the mids and highs are good. Nice voice and guitars, and the lows are terrific for the size. It carries 2  6&#34;; woofers, but it sounds like 10 inches subs.<br />I couldn't be happier with my selection.<br />I got myself a Logitech Bluetooth device and it works perfectly with my ipad and iphone.<br />This thing Rocks. It will be good for a small party(dancing included), if it's not set in an open area. I suggest to place it next to the wall and floor, tilted at 45. This way you get a better bass response and still direct the highs toward the ear level.<br />I used an SPL (sound meter) and at 1 meter it was pushing a very decent 97 dB. That's party level and not good for continuous listening, but it's nice to have it handy for that song that you really love.<br />So, if you want to have the best available sound from a &#34;portable&#34; 100 watt speaker, look no further. The looks are great too. Need Bluetooth? 30 USD and you are set.<br />I loved it so much I have ordered another one to play it in stereo. Now I will have a &#34;portable&#34; party system. Who could ask for more?<br />This speakers are a commemorative item, so they will become collectibles. The original price was 1000 USD. Under $600 they are a steal. They sure sound like a thousand dollars. Thanks Marshall. Thanks Zound Industries. From a grateful sound frea"
5,Easy to set up and worked perfectley.  I was happy that I did not spend the extra money for a dish that automatically finds the signal. I use it on my trailer for camping and love it!!!!!!!!
3,"You get what you pay for.  We have a small TV with awful sound, and this thing only mildly improves it."
5,"I'm giving this five stars purely on function,  it is not the best tactile experience and lacts some programming features but fills a nitch that i could not find anywhere else.  If you are no longer using a cable STB and watch a majority of video content on the web (I'm using it with a Mac mini htpc) and don't want a 40 button monster remote then this is a perfect fit,  Of the three functions, one is your tv which becomes the standard channel up/down volume up/down input select and mute.  The next two become your audio receiver or a/v receiver and the last becomes your media device (apple tv or htpc for example).     Programming is pretty standard but I could not reprogram the menu button since it is used to exit the programming mode.  Other than that the only other problem I have with it is the small throw of the buttons.    I could not find the programming code map on the web so if you are wondering  it includes a very large tv,  av receiver and audio receiver list along with a list of media devices like apple.  That is it - no DVD/blue ray for example.    This product is all about simplification - it's very small (half the size of a standard universal remote), goes completely black (other than the ar label) when it's not moving (it has a tilt sensor to activate the button LEDs) and limits the buttons to an absolute minimum."
5,"Works Great, easy to install, arrived on time and great price. Great picture conversion from HD to analog screen at home."
5,"What can I say really, for 25 bucks, these are incredible earphones. Lows are nice and bassy, and highs are pretty responsive too.<br />I listen to a lot of EDM and I found these to be perfect.<br />For the price, these are a no brainer, and the wood does make a diference, can't really explain it, but I feel it specially in more bassy sounds. Recomended"
2,"I have actually owned (and built) uhf antennas that were shaped like this, but that performed far better.  What irks me most is this came up highly rated in an amazon search for an outdoor antenna that could pick up uhf AND vhf signals.  It is not good for vhf signals, because it has no wide-armed element (I should have known better from my own experience).  It only picks up ONE hd uhf station and that is from the public television tower that is a mere five miles away.  It is advertised as having a range of 55 miles, but that is nonsense!  I am forty miles only from Franklin mountain (el paso) which has several uhf hd channels; there is nothing between me and them, it is a straight, line-of-sight projection; and yet I pick up none of these signals!  I actually did better with an old indoor antenna that I rigged up to sit on the roof!!  I will go back to that one and sell this on amazon.com I guess.    (Oh, I also assembled it correctly, mounted it correctly and followed all other instructions).  Very disappointed!"
5,"Looks just like a picture,works great. I would recommend ."
5,"Good cable, high quality, works great with my new monitor. Do not spend more than $10 - $15 on cables like this. The ones at this price work just as well as any other."
3,I used this heavily but took care of em and didnt blast the music in my ears and the right side of the headphone just died. I would say its not worth the price if they break in less than 2 years and I took care of these headphones but used them heavily maybe I got a bad batch but its hard trusting these ear phone agains espically for the price. thanks for nothing koss. although I will still use my dead headphones because they hide outside noises they wont be put to used as headphones as the right ear died on me.
5,"I highly recommend this mount, I was surprised by the low price (~25$) and quality.  These are perfect for mounting your LCD or plasma to the wall.  I have two of them now and no issues."
5,This the third HDR120 I've purchased.  I'am totally convinced on it's superior performance and quality.  I have three HiFI Wireless  headsets connected to three video or music systems.
4,I purchased this as I got some new watches and the jewelry store wanted $15 each to adjust band.<br />So this was perfect for that. I know that this can also remove the backs to change battery but have not figured out what tool to use yet. If this kit had some directions then I would give it a 5.
5,Very good!
5,"Worked right off, connected to my Nexus 7 2013, connected hdmi to my panasonic tv and it worked without have to restart the tablet or anything. I didn't have any problems with the signal cutting out or with moving the device. Micro sd connections are crap, all of them, and whoever manufactured it just take care of it. Don't try to put them in the wrong way, don't put them on the floor to be stepped on and you won't have the physical connection problems people are complaining about."
5,Excellent product.
4,Met and exceeded expectations.  Got it for my elderly parents who were having difficulty hearing clearly their tb
5,You would never guess that this iPod was refurbished.It looks flawless.
5,"Comfortable, loud, affordable, rechargeable, durable- they're amazing."
5,This is a Great Product for a little price and Everyone with multiple HDMI sources needs one!<br />I love the fact that you don't need an external power supply for this to work.  Also It cleared up<br />a problem I was having with a Roku device having to be rebooted when I switched to it on<br />our Projection System!
1,"I ordered this for my Craig brand DVD player, and it doesn't work, despite having a code for Craig brand DVD players. So I'm unhappy about the fact that I can't even use this at all, but at least it was cheap I guess..."
5,I've had these for more than a year and they're still going strong. I use them for my wireless triggers and they work without a hitch. The charge does seem to last longer than my other batteries. I would recommend purchasing a high quality battery charger to prolong the lives of these and other quality NiMh batteries
5,I have been using the Sony cassettes for more than last 10 years and did not find anything wrong with them.
5,"I replaced the bulb in my Hitachi 50VG825 LCD rear projection TV. The bulb was the original and I was surprised how long it lasted. When the bulb finally gave out, I didn't want to invest a lot in this older TV even though it is just like new. I saw bulbs from 29.00 shipped all the way up to the original Philips unit as high as 150.00. Since there are options with the case and without the case, I read the reviews and decided to forgo the case as most people ended up taking the bulb out of the case and putting it in their original case to get it to fit back in the tv properly. There are two wires that are attached with nuts to the bulb, on on the rear of the bulb and one on the side. Be careful with the one on the side. It is not as secure as the original bulb. Hold it firmly so it can't move and tighten securely. The new bulb was noticibly brighter, possibly because mine was so old. It is like having a new tv, even the colors are brighter. I am happy for now. I am interested to see how long this bulb continues to work, but for the price and improved quality, I can't complain. I will follow up when my new bulb quits!"
5,"I use this little speaker on my work laptop as I never know what to expect when I travel to do presentation work. I have used this in a meeting room that seats 12 to 15 people and everyone can hear, loud and clear. Small and packs easily too."
5,"My sister bought this product first, so we took her recommendation when we were looking for a system. It's small, but comes with a big sound. There are multiple menu options (although we tend to leave it on standard), which can add to the sound clarity.<br />I watch TV while using the elliptical, so being able to turn the sound up and still hear everything over the sounds of the machine is great.<br /><br />The subwoofer doesn't take up much floor space. Purchase, plug in, and relax."
5,"These rechargeable batteries met my expectations and then some. My digital camera, like most, eats up batteries like I eat potato chips. These  Pro Series Premium High Capacity AA 2700 mAh Rechargeables held on through some 50+ photographs and 4 or 5 video clips, all with the LCD turned on. I recommend them highly to anyone who needs batteries that won't die at just the wrong moment.    The battery case is a nice little plus, and the mini tripod is very sturdy and steady, not at all like some flimsy ones I've seen. All in all, this is quite a bit of bang for your buck!"
5,"These earphones work very well for what I use them for. I am a medical transcriptionist. I had been using the bugs, but wanted to try headphones. These work very well. The sound is good and they are lightweight."
1,"Don't waste your time or money on this worthless piece of crap!!  It's made of cheap plastic (probably from China) and after only a very short time, the buttons on top of the watch are no longer working. And as if that wasn't bad enough, I then went out and bought a SECOND stop watch, made by the same company \\""sports line\\"", that at first glance, appeared to be an upgrade.  Bottom line, it too stopped working in a similar fashion and I am now done with sports line.  As a track coach, you can imagine my frustration.  I have since written to the company asking them for a full refund for both items.  This ia a classic example of \\""ya get what ya pay for.\\"""
4,"The radio has awsome sound and is easy to use. It would be great if it has battery backup but I guess it does reset the time when electricity goes out.  It is very hard to read the time in the dark, you have to get right next to the radio to see the time."
5,I love it
4,"They aren't THE BEST sound quality, but the price of these totally makes them worth it. I've tried earphones that have a similar sound, but cost in the $20's range. For 7-9 bucks, these are definitely worth what you pay for them. I use my phones to exercise a lot meaning I do end up replacing these pretty often, but I can feel good about buying these often for such a great price!<br /><br />Would recommend for people who aren't too picky on sound quality. The bass line suffers the most at this price, I think. Also, if you use your smartphone for music, make sure your case leaves plenty of space around the earphone jack."
4,"Just a quick one from me. I own both this pair and the cheaper also excellent HD485. Just a word of warning on the HD555. If you like me enjoy the \\""bottom end\\"" sound of music, perhaps are or were in to dance music in it's many forms, enjoy the sound of the base, perhaps spent a lot of time in dance-clubs as a youth listening to anything from deep house music through to reggae, jungle, drum and bass,  etc then these are not for you in my humble opinion. For classical music, guitar, vocal, folk, rock these are wonderful and have great high end clarity. If you want to hear the warmth of the bottom end save a few dollars or pounds or euros and go for the 485."
4,Good quality good sound great price
3,Doesn't sound as good as they say.
5,Perfect for my situation.....Mounted TV above Mantel and this made it too close to the substrate for a regular plug-in.
5,Takes a minutes to charge and forever to empty the battery ;)) sound is good especially for a small size. Happy with it
5,"Great sound, durable, comes with a collection of 4 tips from small to extra large yea this headphones is awesome"
5,Perfect tool! Recommend. Audio could be a bit louder in a noisy environment.
5,"Perfect cable that allows you to connect a TV some distance away. Great picture quality at 1080p and 720p modes.  All PS3 and Blueray pictures simpely look awsome with no interference or loss of signal. A recommend this cable to anyone needing an HDMI hookup to any blueray, cable box or game counsel."
5,"We love these speakers. For the size and price, you can't beat them."
5,It seems to be as good as the OEM battery that came with the UPS.
5,I am not an expert by any means. I just listen and see if I like what I hear. I found the RS170 to be very comfortable and easy to wear. It took just a little time to get use to where the headphone buttons were but no real problem. Even though the surround sound is digital simulation it is sure good enough for a non expert like me. It also surprised me how quickly the headphones recharged. I have some hearing loss and found that these headphones actually help with clarity of high frequency sounds.  All in all I was very pleased with my RS170 and would highly advise giving them a try. The quality is every bit of what I had expected and more.
4,"Does what is expected of an HDMI cable. Made of good sturdy material, as well as sturdy collars (where cable meets head connector). Recommended usage in light commercial or residential applications. No complaints so far. Have ordered these in various lengths."
1,"I do not recommend buying Able Planet products. I bought a brand new, retail packaged pair of $350 Clear Harmony NC1050 that failed within two weeks.  Under warranty, I requested a repair or replacement, per their written terms on the warranty card.  What they sent back were a pair of USED Sound Clarity NC510B ($149 - they called them &#34;open box&#34; but the padding clearly was worn down). When I complained they said they don't have anything else that is an equal replacement.  After multiple emails, including to their VP of Sales and Marketing, I was promised a new $199 pair. This was still not a fair replacement but they never even sent those! So, buy at your own risk because if your headphones fail, you can't count on this company to honor their warranty or to act in an ethical way."
5,"This wall mount is a very good product. I have my 46 Inch Samsung smart TV conveniently mounted on the wall using the wall mount. Its been couple months now and its holding on great. The installation was also very easy. All you need to ensure is that you locate the stud properly. Beyond that, it was very easy."
3,Pros  Great sound quality  Perfect size - smaller than I expected  Easy installation and file/playlist transfer  A lot of space for the price    Cons  Battery life shorter than expected.  Menu a bit clunky  I've had it for three weeks and am still not used to the touch pad.  I always end up selecting things I don't mean to.  Who needs photos on an MP3 player?  I think they just add that to raise the price. I wish there was an 8GB without photo capability that was less expensive.    Overall  To me the most important thing in an mp3 player is sound quality. That combined with the amount of space and the easy transfer of playlists makes this a good deal.  I would buy it again if I had to do it over.
5,"I have done a lot of research on screens after purchasing an Epson 5010 projector.  That particular projector was a bit past my budget, so I had to cut corners on the screen.  I was looking for the best bang for the buck while trying to achieve the best picture possible.  I found that in the Elite 100&#34; electric screen.  I have owned the screen for about 3 months, but it was only installed 2 months ago.  I wanted to wait a bit before reviewing as I was concerned about a few things I had read in other reviews.  First, I bought this screen at about half the price that it is now.  Amazon had a great deal going right about the time I bought it.  I was worried that a &#34;budget&#34; screen wouldn't do my Epson justice but that is not the case.  The picture is fantastic.  I had read about problems people were having with curling.  The sides of the screen do curl a bit, but it does not affect the picture at all.  The motor is SUPER quiet, and rolls up and down with an elegance that belies the price.  I popped the batteries in, pushed the remote button, and my screen was rolling.  I had called Elite for some suggestions on placement, and they were excellent in responding, and even though they do not install screens they offered advice on how to install my screen in a drop ceiling.  I leave the screen down to avoid wear and tear on the motor, but it works just like it did from day one.  The picture on this screen is better than I could have ever expected, and for a &#34;budget&#34; screen this is just an excellent way to save some money while enjoying your movies in a larger-than-life adventure.  At the price I paid for this, this is just an excellent screen.  Highly recommended."
5,"The adapter and the multiple plugs are extremely useful considering that outlets are often limited, and the competition for them is usually critical."
4,WORKS FINE
5,Very reliable chord. I was surprised that this was such a high quality piece of equipment. Makes my games look great.
5,Great sound!
5,"is work fine now, excelent condition"
5,It's so good I like the sound
5,We love this case! We were able to organize our movies and make our space less cluttered! I highly reccomend this product to anyone who wants to simplify their lives.
5,"I wasn't sure about this product when I ordered but, I am so happy that I did.  I love the fact that I'm able to hide all of my components on the other side of the wall Ans all I see is the TV and the mini repeater sticks to the little frame of the TV and can't be seen.  If you want to hide all your components behind a wall or in a cabinets,  this is a very inexpensive and reliable way to to hide your all your components."
4,These stands are holding big JBL speakers that weigh 50 lbs each.  They are sturdy and look great.  The velcro they send to attach the speakers to the stand is too small for such large speakers; so we got heavy duty double stick tape from the hardware store to cover the whole top of the stand to hold the large speakers.
1,Have used this cd player for less than 6 months and the cd player function no longer works. Cheaply made.
5,Love it!! Will purchase from again. It fits like an otterbox but priced much cheaper. Love the color too! Thanks
5,kicks butt and micro cloth provided is a good size. i will buy it again when i run out.
3,This screen expands and retracts very well and seems well-made. It fits in a suitcase and you can adjust the size to fit on whatever surface is available to you.  My only complaint is that the screen seems a bit grainy which distracts from the images shown a bit.  Not a problem for text or simple PPT slides but noticeable when showing graphics.
1,"I had the a-Jays Four and loved them! I had them for 2 years until they gave up (R.I.P).<br />Now I went and bought these and thought that they would be better...<br />The sound is the same as the a-jays four you really don't hear a difference.<br />The worst thing about this new model now is that they fall out of your ears all the damn time!!!!!!!<br />I mean, whats the point of having &#34;in-ear&#34; headphones when they don't stay in your ear???<br />They are covered in some weird coating that makes them slippery and reason being why they wiggle out all the time.<br />And thinking about working out with these? Don't forget about it. It's not gonna happen. On each and every damn set they will fall out.<br />Frustrating to the bone, worst headphones ever!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!! Buy the previous model instead (a-Jays Four)! THEY ARE WAAAAY BETTER BEYOND MEASURE!"
1,"Do not purchase this item unless your name is Val Kilmer or Viktor Krum. The item was fine except for the fact that my \\""new\\"" iPod nano came engraved with the initials \\""VK.\\""<br /><br />I searched, but could not find any photos with a stock iPod nano marked \\""VK.\\"" Thanks, A&B Imports LTD (Wall Street Photo) for sending me an item which has obviously been used. Perhaps, I will add my initials to the back and then pass it onto another poor unsuspecting buyer.<br /><br />Time for a return."
4,A nice HDMI cable at a decent price. Long enough to work without having to coil up a pile of slack. Might as well get one to go with any HDMI device that doesn't include one and save yourself a trip to the store.
4,"I saw these at an airport tech store and gave them a listen  Great sound but high priced for an impulse buy so I held off.  While waiting for my flight, I decided to check out Amazon reviews and pricing. I was impressed by both so I ordered the Jammin'  Positive Vibration headphones.  Amazon pricing is great!!  I am still really impressed by the sound quality.  The only thing that I don't like is the relatively thin padding and the small degree of adjustment available for the size of the head. I don't have a big head, my friends might say otherwise, and I can get them adjusted but I notice the thin padding. Anyway, great for mowing the lawn and other outdoor work!! Great deal and I recommend them to anyone!"
5,"This is AWESOME. I have 5 hard wired speakers through-out the house. Installation took about 10 minutes and works perfectly. We love it! It replaced a receiver that we had to plug our phone into. This powers all five speakers no problem, sound is great, and user friendliness is great.<br /><br />Could not be happier."
3,"comes in handy, but the rewind is a bit awkward and doesn't seem to fit right."
5,"I Have an older TV ,I did not want to throw it away, I would rather try to make it work than to buy another TV,when this one works just fine thank you for having the right piece of equipment to do the job I was looking for. ..I am very satisfied.<br />Thanks again. ..Mike"
5,Worked Perfect
5,Product was top quality at a great price.  I hooked them up and they work great.  Cannot go wrong with these cables.
5,"The switch works as expected.  We don't use the automatic capability, since the two devices we are switching are always &#34;on&#34;.  So we must push the button to switch.  It works well, and the picture quality is excellent."
5,"When one of my phones on my HD650 seemed to &#34;go out&#34;, the problem turned out to just be defective/old cable.  Replaced it with this and it works fine.  It's quite a bit longer than the original cable so that's a nice upgrade too.  All in all I'd say it was a pretty good buy."
5,"They work. What more needs to be said. Nice price for a 2-pack, way better than the local stores who charge an arm and a leg for just one adapter."
1,"I cannot get the music to mix. Date & clock won't set correctly. Touch screen hard to use and touchy. When I called Coby to get tech to help they said I won a $100 prize. When I told them not interested the rep hung up on me. I have 4 coby products and was happy w/first 2. But, unhappy w/customer service and product of the last 2 products. Will not be interested in coby products or even consider it in the future."
5,"I have it on my TV. It seems safe, it was easy to install, and moves my TV freely or loosely (depending on how you adjust it) just like it said it does."
4,"A bit of a hefty cord if your using ear bugs, but does the job and has great length.  Best thing you can get at a cheap price"
5,"Gave this to my nephews to help keep their Thomas train set running.  Well, I guess I gave it to my brother.  Works great...a fantastic starter set to get someone up to speed in reusable batteries."
5,Very good sound quality for a compact system.  Easy to assemble and move from room to room..
3,"I found these to be great for what I use them for.  I needed a lightweight pair of buds to listen to audio books.  Having a pair of large headphones on for extended periods would get uncomfortable after a few chapters.  I've tried listening to music with them and would have to say that theyare adequate ear buds for using music as background noise when doing activities. If you actually want to listen to enjoy your music I would recommend a set with more range. The built-in volume control is a nice feature on this price point as well.<br /><br />PROS:  Price point on these are great, as I got a set for less than $15<br />  Volume control slider<br />  Three sizes of flanges<br />  Cable manager/wrap included<br />  Audio book vocals are nice and clear<br /><br />CONS:  Flimsy construction<br />  Mids and lows frequency sounds are muddled for music listening"
5,This headphones are better than beats<br />For a great price . If you don't care for brand names you will love this headphones.
5,I got more channels than I thought I would.  I will be canceling my subscrip to dish on the 20th.  I will miss my dvr and pause and record.  Wish there was something out there for me to do this with without being sucked into monthly bills.
5,"If you compare this one to the older version side by side, you can clearly hear and feel the improved bass. This little guy is  bass machine and is very damn loud too (at least in my living room, I haven't tested it outside). Now you can control volume from the speaker itself. Overall very satisfied with this."
4,"Pros  - Only 2 pieces as opposed to 7 with a traditional 5.1 setup, which also means...  - Only 2 wires! A power cord and a wire to connect the sub/receiver to the soundbar.   - Decent sound. This is NOT going to sound better or even as-good-as a standard 5.1 system, don't fool yourself.   - Price. My wife found these for $250, and that's a pretty darn good price.  - Connections. The thing has a LOT of them.    Cons  - The remote. Seriously, the thing has about 40 buttons and I only use 5, volume up/down, mute, power and input. And crazy enough, even those aren't laid out very well.  - Setup. People complain that there is no mid-range or that voice is hard to hear. These are people who obviously have either never set up a 5.1 sound system before or didn't read the manual. By default, the center channel is very quiet and the subwoofer is very loud. It took me about 15 minutes of going through the manual before I finally figured out how to alter those two settings, and now there's no issue with quiet speech or the lows drowning out the highs.  - As I mentioned, this does not sound as good as a 5.1 system.        Soundbars are for people who want decent sound at a reasonable price and don't want to monkey with receivers or wires snaking through their walls or under their carpet. In that regard, this product is a resounding success. I lament the fact that I don't get a true surround sound experience anymore, but I'm happy that my children no longer pull my speaker stands down on top of them, or futz with my receiver's buttons and throw everything off. It's easy (once you set it up) and it sounds great. You can't ask for much more than that."
5,"Used it to connect a wired LAV to my camera. I've never used a better 3.5mm cable! Great snap when I make the connection, I know I'm good to go without disconnecting. Gold heads help me know I've got the best connection between cables. Great sound quality despite the length."
4,"I love the sound of the Plenue, and it's light weight and easy use is awesome.<br />It seems to have a sort of sad Android OS, but what it lacks there it makes up in sound quality.<br />My Plenue seems to only hold a charge for about six hours.<br />Based on all the advertising six hours is a bit shy of the time it should hold a charge for.<br />I got it from Amazon.<br />They have a return button there which maybe I can use to have them fix it?<br />I am unsure.<br />I am mostly happy with my product, even with the battery flaw."
5,Hearing loss is a symptom of a problem...see an audiologist and get your hearing tested to find you WHY!    [...]
3,Didn't work in the area.
4,"Hold a charge well, a good buy."
5,Converts my audio from my BR which only has digital audio output to rca outputs so I can connect it to my stereo system. Does a great job..
1,I received this cassette player and it chopped clean the tape in the cassettes. This pile of tapes hadn't been listened to for a long time so I thought it was my old player. But then it ate a couple including one of my favorites.  The player it was supposed to replace was a $15 player that worked for years.  Boycott them.
5,Awesome mount.  Heavy duty metal. No issues installing. 65 IN samsung
4,I ordered this to replace a bad cable on my Blu Ray player. It seems to have fixed the problem. I ordered this because I wanted a good quality cable for a replacement. This looks to be a good high quality cable and may even be over kill so to speak. This link is a better description than the one in the add.... http://www.keydigital.com/items.asp?ItemCode=KDHDRJ6&Company=KEY
2,"I bought these grills to replace some old ones on my boat.  I had one existing grill from the original speakers so I used that as a basis for size.  When ordering these I was careful to measure twice with the measurements given on the website, comparing that to the existing grill.  When I received them and went to install them they were too large to the speakers.  Be careful of the size if this is for a replacement grill."
5,"Bought these headphones based on good Amazon reviews, and I wasn't disappointed. Initially, I was turned off by the price, but I've since forgotten about the money and have remained impressed by the durability and sound quality of these headphones. At first, I hated the design (behind the head cord), but have since grown to love it. Would definitely buy again, no question."
5,"Well folks, 2012 is finally here and some people tell us it's the end of the world again. Are you prepared if something natural or manmade knocks out the power system for an extended period of time?<br /><br />A solar eruption like the Carrington Event of 1859 would fry the planet's electrical grids. Try manufacturing millions of replacement transformers when the world has gone dark; it could literally take years to restore power. Then there's foreign enemies setting off EMP weaponry high in the atmosphere with the same devastating result. Of course, more mundane weather disasters could also knock out power.<br /><br />The K-TOR Pocket Socket along with a battery recharger and rechargeable batteries will give you some solace and keep your battery powered lanterns, CD player-radios, fans, and other devices working. I tested my K-Tor on recharging the batteries in my portable 9 inch DVD player. The good news is that I can relax in my bunker and keep watching my favorite programs on DVD after civilization has collapsed. The bad news is that it takes over 3 minutes of \\""light, easy cranking\\"" for every 1 minute of viewing. Or you can attach your K-TOR to the Lenmar DVDU923 battery pack; recharging it offers a lot more resistance and requires some muscle power, but delivers about 16 minutes of viewing for 5 minutes of cranking. [[ASIN:B0011MZORU Lenmar DVDU923 Universal Li-Ion Battery for Select Portable DVD Players]] A competitor, the ERDVDMAX battery pack provides 17 viewing minutes for 5 cranking minutes. [[ASIN:B00076QBHS Technuity ERDVDMAX Battery, Universal Nimh for Portable]]<br /><br />My initial effort at battery recharging suggests it could take an hour or more of cranking to recharge four AA battteries. Obviously, only an exercise freak would use this device so long as electricity is flowing out of wall sockets. But if/when there's no other source of electrical power, the K-TOR could be worth its weight in gold."
4,"Works good, shipping was 3 to 4 weeks. can't beat the price !"
4,Great speakers.... but just calling out that it can't charge the new iPhone 3G.  (You can use it to play music from the iPhone 3G though.)
5,"These are awesome. You don't have to worry about broken latches on regular cd cases. Its a fun idea, but they used to not be this expensive."
1,"I bought this headphone amp to get louder sound from my ipod nano through my AKG K271 55 ohm headphones.  The amp hardly made a difference in volume with the ipod nano however it did add a noticeable amount of noise.  I then tried the amp on my stereo system and got blasted with volume.  I'm not sure why this happened since the unit is supposedly powered by its own battery.  Also, when I had the amp plugged into my stereo, it created enough noise to be very distracting.  I found this product to be of poor quality and useless."
2,I am an over the ear rather than bud user but I don't know why I bought these dorky looking things. Would wear them at home but the piece that fits over the ear is very tight and I am a very small person so I don't know who they would comfortably fit.
5,"Exactly what I needed in a portable stereo.  Good sound, rugged construction.  Very satisfied."
2,"unable to get the headphones to work, they turn on but that's it. Not sure what is going on with them."
5,ok
1,They are not sweet proof!!  The only reason I bought them is to wear when I work out with the adjustable  volume button on the cord.  The volume button does not work any more and now they are just like my other headphones.  Do not buy them if this is what you intend them for like me.
5,good quality audio
1,Does not work. Wasted my money on this.
5,Excellent reciever
5,"Great sound, even out of my 8 dollar mp3 player. No complaints about these headphones. They work and sound great!"
5,great service-good product
5,These are perfect for the price. Easy to transfer music to and you can't beat the price. I also like the fact you can expand the memory if you have to. Very compact and the battery lasts a good time. I purchased these for my kids who are 10 and 9 and they are enjoying them. Great Product.
5,I only use that as a title because I think one has to remember they are swimming so the sound quality and such will not be like you are used to when using for 'dry' workouts.  Yes there is a tinny sound but it wasn't anything that took away from the fact that you can listen to your favorite music and get a longer more enjoyable swim.<br /><br />I found it hard to adjust to the ear piece that wraps around your ear; partly because it pressed to the back of my head with my swim cap; the ear piece may fall out when you do a flip turn.  Also the sound may go in and out (water in the ear?) when you flip too.<br /><br />Securing the shuffle to the back of my goggle strap works the best; I don't have to worry about the wires getting in my way.
5,"works well, very small - it's great for packing and not taking up a ton of room on the wall"
5,Good product and delivery was performed as expected
5,"I use this cassette player to listen to audio books. Although expensive, it is sturdy, has good sound quality, a useable belt clip, and both fsst reverse and fast forward controls. In short, it is exactly what I wanted, having tried less expensive players. The FM radio reception is good too."
5,I received this product two days after ordering it.  The cable is very thick and the connector ends are built very well and are sturdy.  I ran this cable from my projector through the ceiling to my receiver which has a P3 and HD cable box connected.  There is no signal or quality loss at all.  This same cable goes for around $75 at your nearby stores so don't waste the extra money.  Product works great!
1,The bulb burnt out within days.  I got rid of the TV I used these bulbs for because none of the lamps I bought worked.
5,Great !
3,"Works, not high quality."
3,"I purchased this model before in White, for use with my Ipods.  I have been very satisfied both times.  The only problem I have is that the buds have a tendency to slip out of my ear, even with the smallest supplied pads attached."
4,"I like this product, looks and feels real!"
2,"For me size of the cells were important to fit in space. As it was not mentioned in specification, I bought them thinking they will be AA size but are much bigger."
4,Came fast and they are perfect
5,"I was looking for a compact 90 degree angle hdmi adapter. Amazon listed many of them at various prices. I settled on this one as the images were all consistent for the product. I looked at others, cheaper and more expensive, and the images were inconsistent. As it was imperative that when I plugged these into my audio receiver, the female end pointed up, I went with these adapters. The compact design allowed me to be able to push my receiver into the cabinet farther in order to shut the cabinet doors. If you are looking for a compact design adapter, go with this company."
5,"We have been purchasing DVD's for several years, and have tried many of the higher priced brands.<br /> The Memorex DVD's are consistantly of good quality, and are priced much lower than the \\""top brands\\"". They are of medium thickness and have a much lower rate of error in copying. The sound quality is very high.<br /> After much trial-and-error, these are our brand of choice."
5,"I thought I'd try these replacement batteries for our aging units, rather than buy entire (expensive) units. I've tried them in two of the APC UPS units we have and they've performed beautifully. I'm going to go ahead and get some more to have on hand for our other APC UPSes."
4,The antenna I received looks slightly different & I think the stand is basic crap HOWEVER it works really well! I think for the price it really is a good buy and I would recommend it as a purchase.
5,Worked well at first. At this time there is a crackling in the sound. Don't understand why.
2,Cheap! Breaks easily
5,Great inexpensive headphones. I have been using them for about 2 months now. Would buy again if these ever break (which i doubt would be soon).
5,"It's like an extension cord, but it's like only 1 foot long!  Seriously!!! I was shocked that such a product was even available!  At first glance one would think, \\""Now why would anyone want an extension cord that is only 1 foot long?\\""  Hey, I know, I know...  it seems silly, but MAN does this product ever rock!  You can string three of them together and get like a THREE foot extenstion cord!  Now tell me you have never wanted a 3 foot extension cord - cmon.  Or how about a 7 foot extension cord?  String seven of these bad boys together and you are happening brother.  Who hasn't gone to the store and thought that the 6 foot was just not long enough and the eight foot was like WAY overkill.  For the love of all that's holy why do they not make a SEVEN foot extension cord!!!  Well, now you can make your own!!!  It's like a little 1 foot slice of electrical heaven... good times... good times...<br /><br />Or you can just use it to plug all those bulky AC/DC adapters into a single powerstrip without taking up two or three plugs each.  That works too I guess..."
2,"The sound quality on these is great, but background noise can be heard easily with these on even when they're turned up.  The main reason why I don't like this is because the front part of the headphone band at the top rest on my head while the back part doesn't.  After using these for a half hour and trying to make them comfortable I couldn't find a way.  All the weight of the headphones are on that little part of the band and it hurts after a while.  I really wanted to like these, but they are just too uncomfortable for me :("
5,It was easy to install and is still working. I have used Tripp Lite in all of my equipment for many<br />years.
5,Just got it today can't believe the great sound. Took it out of the box in my car paired it unbelievable .<br />Haven't had it long enough to rate the battery's
5,"This product is just brilliant. Simple, logical layout of control buttons is almost perfect.  The online set up could be better but excellent customer support can help you work through some of the more arcane questions. Once set up, it controls all of the major operational functions of every device. Couldn't be happier with this purchase."
5,Really nice cabling.  Kept a signal from my portable DirecTV dish that I use while RVing.  Kept the HD signal nicely.
3,"There are many things to like about this radio. It appears to be of high quality construction, the tuning knobs have a good feel to them and operate smoothly, and it has a sound bigger than the relatively small size of the speaker would suggest. There are some problems with it, however, mainly related to SSB and weak signal reception. I would urge prospective buyers to research the radio in the Yahoo Groups for the PL-880. It was brought out in the group that there appear to be multiple firmware revisions available, and that batch 8820 is the most recent. Earlier versions had even more problems than the 8820, so do yourself a favor and check.<br /><br />The radio does have sync detection available by pressing and holding either one of the SSB keys. However, sync does not hold well at all, and it also adds considerable distortion. There are multiple filter options available, but SSB is limited to 4 KHz, even when sync detection is activated, which limits the fidelity of the radio. There are also other problems with the current firmware which cause the bandwidth to change when you try to tune a SSB signal, and also cause the audio to jump around when trying to listen to a weak signal. The front end overloads easily with an outdoor antenna, even when the signal is attenuated by using the 3 position switch to cut down the antenna gain.<br /><br />If all you are looking for is a good looking radio with a great sound for AM and FM only, I would recommend it. If you will be listening to more Shortwave, Longwave, or SSB, and want a functional sync detector with a reasonable bandwidth for good fidelity, then I would hold off until the design matures more. Also beware firmware revisions 8819 and below at this time. These should be &#34;B&#34; stock and not sold as new."
5,"Having purchased a smaller unit Eaton several years ago, I was prepared to be unimpressed.  But this slightly larger unit has far superior tuning, reception and sound quality.  I was disappointed to see that it doesn't come with a wall adapter, but later realized that it's not necessary because the crank is so incredibly effective. A brisk two-minute crank literally powered the radio for over five hours! It's so easy there really seems to me to be little reason to install batteries in storage and watch them slowly die.<br /><br />It should be noted that the manual indicates a limit on the total number of manual charges the internal battery can sustain, which means cranking may not be a suitable technique for routine operation!  But as a standby communication device it seems just about perfect.<br /><br />I'm quite impressed with the value contained in this nice little package."
4,"I have a few days with this turntable and I have to say that so far so good.  The sound is good, the automatic start/stop play feature, the USB conection, the integrate amp and the free software are good things.      Perhaps a counterweight is missing in order to avoid skipping.  Even though it's a good equipment for the money you pay.    Spanish:  Tengo algunos das con este tocadisco y le spuedo decir que hasta el momento ha funcionado como se esperaba.  Tiene buen sonido de reproducin, el mecanisco automtico para iniciar y parar mientras toca un disco, la conexin USB para conectarse directamente a la computadora, el amplificador integrado que permite conectarle a receivers sin entradas tipo phono y el software gratis que trae (Audacity, Pyro) lo hacen atractivo al comprador.    Lo unico que hace falta para hacerlo perfecto es talves un contrapeso para evitar los saltos (skips) en los discos que no estn en ptimas condiciones.    Pero puedo decirles que es un buen equipo por el diner"
5,I've got a number of headset and headset/mic headphones that I don't care to replace just because the ear cushions tear or crumble.  These replacements are just the ticket.
5,Great product.
4,"I love this Zune. As a fan of Joy Division and their descendant New Order, I couldn't wait to buy it when it was released. While I have a low numbered unit (#35) I paid over $350 for it from the Zune Store thinking, incorrectly, that with only 500 units world wide they would sell out quickly. Now nearly 7 months later it looks like Microsoft sold their remaining stock to Amazon to unload. Oh well, it is a fine device and the presentation is awesome; the photos do not do it justice. Another bonus is this version is the only way to get an all black Zune. The other models have a stainless steel back. Not a big deal, but it does make it look better."
5,This item is great.  Easy installation.  Great price and it does its job well
1,"It's hard to tell from the picture, but the polka dot pattern is noticeably uneven and the paint was already chipping off around the corners. And the plastic is so thin and brittle that it broke when I tried to remove it from the phone."
1,Terrible...Chinese knock off....does not work with Nexus 7 as advertised. I thought I was getting a quality board and it was just a piece of junk. Working on returning. No comment on return experience yet. Lots of similar feedback on various discussion boards.
1,I was really disappointed on this order. Till today I have not seen this order and my kids were really looking forward for it. I'm still hoping to see it soon it has been a month since I order it
5,We hung a big TV on the wall and I hated having the cables hanging all over. This does not require an electrician since you're just plugging the power cord in. I recommend that you add all the cables you can plug into the TV  not just the ones that you already have the components for. It was VERY easy but I think if I had to go back and add more cables later it would be difficult to fish them through the wall so plan ahead.
5,Bought it to mount my daughter's tv on the wall. It serves its pourpose even though she doesn't swing the tv out like she thought she would
5,This little radio does what it's advertised to do. Digital AM/FM tuner in a rugged package. No bells or whistles that you don't need anyway. Battery compartment has a rubber gasket to keep water out. No Complaints!
5,"For my polk audio 6751 speakers these were perfect, they look awesome and are perfect for what I needed because I have two surround sound junction boxes at the back of my room and they fit with no problems, that's what's cool about these is that they fit any normal single gang electrical outlet. I would definitely buy again but it is a little pricey for a pair."
4,"Loud and great range, much more Bluetooth distance than my sony speaker. Minor hiccup in connectivity once where it wouldn't recognize my already synced phone but that's likely because I was going back and forth between connected devices. Overall good value, although the dock station is fussy as well. Sticking to the Bluetooth option. Loud beats and great sound quality."
5,works good
3,excellent in price range
4,"Haven't actually tried it underwater as of yet.  One thing I did notice is that the version of shuffle sent was one generation removed where it doesn't support double click advance to the next track.  No big deal, but worth a mention."
5,"These probably aren't really good for music. I'm not an expert, but I can definitely tell the difference from high end headphones from these.<br /><br />However, I listen to talk show radio from my cell phone mostly, and for that they work excellent"
4,"Location can allow these antennas to work well or worse than a short antenna because near by objects can greatly effect the signal.  In the open with an antenna which is not broken I have seen noticeable improvement.  However indoors I have had to move the location so that the longer antenna would work properly, like it would in an open field.  If you can not get away from metal objects within a foot or two at the same level as your wifi devices then yes this could likely give worse results than a short antenna, but the fault is how radio waves travel not the design of the antenna itself."
5,For the low price it enabled me to continue my T.V. viewing when an older remote device was not dependable for making the channel changes that I desired.
5,Great value!
1,"I connected this to my DirectV DVR to try it out.  I was going to connect to my receiver and Blu-ray player once i knew it was working properly.  I worked for me for about 2 to 3 sessions,  after that it stopped working.  The receiver would light up like it was picking up the remote IR,  the box would flash the blue llight when this happened but the emitters would not work.  I tried for a couple hours trying every possible combination,  with no luck.  I think you get what you pay for.  I am sure there are many people that purchase this and never have any problems.  I believe that if I bought another one,  it may work for me also,  but I am not going to get burned twice by the same device."
5,"Works perfectly. Arrived quickly and I've had no problems. A fantastically cheap alternative to anything at retail stores in town. I use it to plug my MacBook Air into my Samsung 32&#34; via a display port adapter and it works every time. I wanted a long cord to avoid the bending and tweaking that a short cord would have to make between the couch and the TV, and this delivered--for like $13 cheaper than a 6 foot cord at the store. Would recommend to anyone looking to save money."
5,Good replacement.
3,"The price really says it all, and that applies to every pair of headphones/ear buds you buy. For this cheap price I would probably recommend these, especially if you want a pair that you can treat like crap and an alternative.<br /><br />I've had problems keeping these fitting in my ears but do feel well they're properly fitted. The sound definitely isn't great but is plenty loud. For it's price its a good buy."
5,Sturdy product. No play. Would recommend for others
4,Work well when i connected my computer up to my tv. And responds great when i hook my xbox up with it. overall great product.
5,"Why waste time in the shower when you could be getting your daily news? This unit has worked perfectly - can't speak about overall reception, as I stick to one station (which comes in clear without any static). If you don't have a shower radio, you should really purchase this unit. It's small, easy to hang or lay on a shelf, has easy to use controls, and good sound. Plus, at the price, it's an inexpensive way to get your news."
5,I bought this after doing lot of research. I wanted a reliable pair for my Camera which can be used just out of the box and I don't have to worry to charge them one night before going on any trip. Eneloop Batteries keep the charge for longer times in duration when they are not used. and these have served me likewise for last 1 year without any issues.
5,i purchased  this mount for a 42 inch tv. It did not fit. Had to purchase the next size up.
5,I got this for my phone at work because they only have big headsets.  This is great for my small head :)
5,"I received my \\""AAA\\"" charged out of the box.  Using a Lacrosee BC-700 battery charger's charge/test function, each battery was rated as follows:<br /><br />Battery 1 = 868 mAh<br />Battery 1 = 875 mAh<br />Battery 1 = 892 mAh<br />Battery 1 = 878 mAh<br /><br />Consistent with its rating of 850 mAh.<br /><br />Recyko is the low self discharge nickel metal hydride battery manufactured by GP (Gold Peak - a Hong Kong based company).  I find them comparable to other low-discharge batteries from Sanyo, Rayovac, Duracell, Yuasa, etc.  Package says 850 mAh, 1.2V.  Printed on the battery itself says 820mAh.  These batteries does not look as sleek and sexy as the Eneloops; they are wrapped in thin metallic plastic, but for sure pack a lot of juice for the money. Made in China."
4,This charger is a good replacement for the original that came with the Kindle.  Fits snug and cord is a decent length.
5,"I bought this cable very cheap at Amazon (about 2$). It is working perfectly, connecting my PS3 and an Onkyo 606 receiver, for HD video and HD sound. Image and sound are crisp and of the same quality as a much more expensive cable that I bought before but it was too short for my needs.  From now on, I would not spend a dime more than necessary in cables, specially for digital signals.  As always, Amazon and its partners delivered the item as promised. Easy and clean transaction."
5,Awesome product. Has clean results
5,Great quality and worth the tiny investment
5,Great product. As long as you can either adjust the anvil on your compression tool or have one for 18 mm. They seal tight around RG6 quad and the o-ring seal will keep out moisture in the connection.
1,Their product description says the product is comparable with Mac. But there was no driver for Mac. It did not work for my MacBook so I returned the item
5,"I got this to connect my laptop to my 26\\"" (720p) HDTV. Connection is extremely easy, as its a simple plug and play type of set-up. Video quality is rich and fills the full screen. I think the cable can support up to 1080p, but I don't have a 1080p TV, so I cannot confirm that. Audio quality works seamlessly as well.    According to research I did on Google, there is no noticeable difference in quality between the $60 cables sold in stores and the $6 cables sold online, until you get to very long length cables. At 15', this cable is certainly long enough for me, and is WAY cheaper than the alternative, so I would certainly recommend it to anyone."
5,I needed these batteries to replace the leaking batteries in my home burgular alarm.  They seem to be working just fine.
5,Great product
5,"Well, this review doesn't need to be too long.  Here are the pros:<br /><br />1.) $1.42 -- How does anybody turn a profit to ship something in a padded envelope for a little over a dollar?  Great bargain!<br />2.) Sturdy cable -- The wire gauge is posted, but just to give some feedback, these are not the little flimsy ones you sometimes see.  This is a very sturdy cable.<br />3.) Sound quality -- This is being used to connect an Iphone to aftermarket automobile 3.5mm jack.  The goal is more functionality than quality of sound, but there is no noticeable difference between using this cable over the short lead that is attached to the stereo.<br /><br />Cons: It's hard to think of any..."
5,"We took this on our recent trip to Europe.  All the ports work.  It charged our iphone, ipad mini, samsung note 2 and nook hd.  Great little workhorse. Nice to be able to charge all our electronics at one time."
4,"I opted for these over the plastic aftermarket alternatives and I'm glad I did. These things are extremely solid. The only complaint is that their dimensions do not allow for the speakers to be rotated a complete 90 degrees (rear surrounds for example); they don't quite stick out far enough and the speaker will hit the wall before it reaches 90 degrees. I somewhat expected this but wished for just another inch, maybe less, of extension from the wall. Still, a wonderfully made product worthy of the awesome ProCinema speakers they support."
4,"very well, nice desing, it's for anyone, easy to use, i like it. i reccomended. the seller was excellent too. just have to take care, cause it arrived like broke."
2,"Used them for about a week then on of the speakers blew, just sounds fuzzy now.<br /><br />should be some kind of a limiter on there or something.<br /><br />It's a shame because i really liked these speakers, compact and easy to use.<br /><br />I'd also rather have something where you don't have to switch off the speaker every time, so when you unplug the USB the battery turns of also, then you press a button to use the battery."
4,"Needed a new alarm clock, nothing fancy, but had to be dependable with easy to read numbers, yet soft on the eyes. The Sony display numbers are 0.9 tall in a light green LED, which are very good. This Sony device fits the bill with a fairly small footprint (approx 6 wide, 6 deep and 3.25 high). In fact, for the money paid, it comes with a couple of features that, for me, are a bonus.  First, it has Automatic Time Set, which is adjusted by your time zone, and should never have to be reset with the built-in lithium battery.  With that is a daylight savings time adjustment feature that works automatically with the built-in calendar. This is not a huge deal, but a very nice convenience.  But I did get this primarily for its alarm feature and it does not disappoint. There are two alarm settings (A and B) and I use A for weekdays and B for weekends.  Nice and convenient.  While it does have a snooze control that works, I do not particularly use that feature, but it is there if and when needed. The tunerty good and will, more than likely, be affected by how well AM and FM signals are in your specific area. For me, I am able to capture my favorite few stations.  Overall, this Sony AM/FM Clock Radio is a very good purchase."
1,"If your buying these for the Jaybird bluebud X headphones these DO NOT FIT! even after reading multiple reviewers saying they will fit, trust me they do not!"
5,Lightweight but very powerful!
3,"When the stations come in, picture is nice, bright and clear. Only drawbacks are that the stations fade in and out and you cant tell what direction the antenna is turning when you move it with the remote. I know that station location and distances are a big factor. For the money, its a good deal."
5,Muy bueno...
2,"I purchased this docking station/speaker set after checking out reviews and watching a Youtube video on its simplicity.  I like the idea of the detachable speakers, but the unit did not function very well and I returned it.  It's affordable and may be appropriate for a dorm room or the like."
5,I've had these guys for nearly 4 years now. They are still the best bluetooth headphones I've put on.<br /><br />Old but still by far the best I've used (10+ others).<br /><br />- Insanely comfortable over-the-ear (even when you have big ears like me).<br />- Battery lasts days and days without charge even after 3+ years.<br />- Sound quality is still the best bluetooth I've found.<br />- Robust as hell. I treat these things rough as hell and there's now a small rattle when I shake my head around. That's it.
4,great price good product
4,"I've owned these for a little over a month, and for a long time they were really nice to have. The sound quality was fine, and I just loved the tie dye design. Unfortunately, just the other day, the sound changed. Music now sounds slightly garbled and almost metallic, and I can't find a reason as to why. The wires are all in tact, and the headphones seem to be in fine condition.  I'm thinking maybe I accidentally crushed them in my bag (as these headphones do feel slightly flimsy) or maybe it's a defective product. I will be ordering a new pair next week in any case, only because I love these headphones a lot, and want to know whether or not I accidentally broke my original pair somehow, or if it's a faulty product.  Either way, I'd say store these carefully if you're bringing them with you out of the house. The plastic is a bit too lightweight to suggest it can withstand a lot of abuse."
3,Works great.<br /><br />Don't run the coaxial for your Internet cable modem through this.  It works the majority of the time but it will disconnect periodically and seems the signal is degraded for internet traffic through it.
3,"It does what it's supposed to, what else can you say about an adapter? It's everything I could ever ask for in an adapter. ;-)"
5,"I own the 705 with 7.1 wharfedale RS-10 speakers. I love it. I talked to my audio tech about the impedance and output power, something we do once a week. By no means do I know what I'm talking about, but the 805 topic came up and without me asking he immediately said that the 805 get's very hot when you mixed speakers with different impedance, example 8 ohms center and 6 ohms surround speakers, I know the receiver can handle both, but it makes is very hot. This comes from an audiophile. Well just helping does who might be having problems with their units running HOT. :)    Mine doesn't even get hot and is running 7 120w 6 ohms speakers, plus 250w sub. Here is the link in case you care to know what speakers I'm using. [...]"
5,did as advertised
1,Broke nearly as soon as it was out of package. Plugged it in once and then tried to unplug and the head came apart in pieces. The price is great but sometimes you get what you pay for.
5,Great Item
5,"These batteries are super normal and cheaper than the rest. Plus, they came quickly to my front door. I was worried at first because I am used to buying name brand batteries but these work just great. I cannot say much for their lifetime as I have only had them for a month."
4,Very nice MP3. <br /> <br />Easy to Use can ft about 35 Wav Files
5,"I guess it seemed like a good idea at the time, but putting a display port output on laptops just doesn't make much sense.  All displays are going to HDMI.  I know there are benefits to DP but for me it was just a nuisance.  This is a great high quality cable adapter.  No need to carry around some special HDMI to DP cable.  Just carry this and use the HDMI cable that everyone has laying around.  Problem solved."
3,Just purchesed as a spair.
5,"I bought this strap to cinch down my custom Maglite holder in my truck. I like that there are two straps in the pack. I can assure you that what ever you wrap this around, will not move. Very well made cinch strap."
4,"I must admit, I was a little worried by the reviews I read; seems a lot of people had trouble with these headphones.  Thankfully, my experience has been compltely positive.    I bought these because I have a new baby, and in the rare instance that I have free time to play a game, I didn't want it to wake her up.  These are fantastic for gaming.  The sound comes through clearly and- once you find the right channel & frequency- static-free.  I will go so far as to say it even enhanced my gaming experience because I don't have surround sound, and with these stereo headphones I can now tell which direction a sound in the game is coming from.    The range is fairly short, but if you're using it to watch TV or play video games that isn't a problem.    One point of consideration if you're buying this for the same reason as I did: one of the channels (there are 3 total) is the same as our baby monitor (Graco), so it couldn't be used.  Also, even on the channel that doesn't interfere, if I wear them into the room with the baby monitor microphone, there is substantial feedback.  So there's probably no way to use them too close to the nursery.    Overall, this is a fantastic product for the price; this headset is about half of what the other highly reviewed sets were ranging.  I absolutley recommend them."
5,"I liked these so much, I ended up coming back for another pair. They do not have the absolute best sound and they are not my favorite headphones, but for the price I love them! They have lasted longer than some of the more expensive ones I have purchased."
5,It worked perfectly with my fuzz buster! Thanks
4,I like it!
5,"It's SUPER simple to set up and all you have to do is determine where you want the display to appear. The screen is a little bright, but that is easily resolved. Waking up in the middle of the night not to have to look around for the clock has never been easier."
1,This arrived quickly but did not fit our 42&#34; TV.  The mounting bolts on our TV are spaced 24&#34; apart and the widest the mount will stretch is  17&#34;.  Be sure to measure the TV you plan to mount before purchasing. Returning for a refund.
3,"I have projected my BEN Q W 1070 projector from 14.5 feet from the ceiling, however it does not fit this screen from that distance for 100 inches as the even after lens shift etc, it does not fit into this screen."
5,Excellent product.  Although I originally had some problems with the product the seller was very quick to correct them. I will be buying from these people again.
1,"Avoid this product. 7 out of 10 discs failed to properly burn. One would think I should have had 10 successful burns, but only 3? How I would love to return these for a complete refund. But since I only had 30% successful burns, I cannot. I would have been better off burning my money instead. I would have felt like it was well spent. Not on this shabby product."
2,"This was a great try at a universal remote.  Nice size and features.  Unfortunately it only worked with one of my Direct TV STB's and not the other one.  Also, the biggest disappointment was that it requires &#34;line of sight&#34; between the remote and STB to work.  The factory Direct TV remote will work through a closed cabinet or around corners.  Not the Flipper, no way.  For this reason alone I would have sent them back."
5,"This product is just the right stuff for me.  Somehow, I missed any instruction that mentions fiber optic cable as a requirement to connect this machine to the HDTV.  It took 2 days to figure this out. Now this machine works like a gem with my HDTV.  I am waiting for my blu ray (smart) to connect to this system.  I guess I will need to update my system every couple of years to stay current with all the new digital developments. My old audio system was 7 years old and already looks like an antique compared to this system. .<br />Forget about the technical support.  It took almost 2 hours to get someone on the line.....and that was not even helpful.  The Tech guy asked me to ship it back for service.<br /><br />6/2/13: Update:<br />I used cheap HDMI cable (just my thought) to setup this system with my smart Philips HDTV. Everything was fine until about 4 months later when my HDTV firmware update; then my Philips HDTV would no longer output sound through the Audio System.  I finally got it right again after replacing the HDMI cable with a genuine and more expensive one.  Now my Audio System and my HDTV are back in sync.  You will need a good quality (certified) HDMI cable for these electronics to get what you want out of them.  It is still a 5 star."
5,"Got to say, for a fixed wall hung bracket you can not get a better deal. I am extremely happy with my purchase of the wall hung bracket. [[ASIN:B0012S4APK Cheetah Mounts APTMM2B Flat Screen TV Wall Mount Bracket for 32-65-Inch Plasma LED LCD TV]]"
5,"&#34;Windows 7 Vista XP Media Center MCE PC Remote Control and Infrared Receiver for Home, Premium and Ultimate Edition&#34; Works great.  I actually only bought it for the receiver.  I used my learning remote to learn the signals being sent by this remote.  I use it to control XBMC with my regular TV learning remote.  Love it!"
5,Great audio headphones for the price. But recommend trying the Boss headphone for excellent quality sound.
5,"I've been hooked on buying Surefire branded CR123's for years, as they were a value and well made.  Even they are overpriced compared to the Tenergy.  They are proving to last longer and the price per battery is amazing."
5,This antenna worked as advertised . I mounted it in the attic and the reception was better than i expected .The new HD format gave me more channels and the picture was strong and clear.
5,"This walkman is like most of all of sonys items,easy to<br />work sounds great i have not had it long enough to tell<br />if it's is going to last a good while.The way it looks<br />and the way it feels i hope so.Thanks Mike."
5,I tried several products like this but have yet found one that worked as easy as this one. I recommend this product to anybody needing a serial adapter. The driver selection covers almost every OS including Mac.<br />Again Great Product!
5,"I just got this new cd player and it rocks! It's really thin so it can go almost anywhere, and it comes with a whole set of things to go with it, like a thingy to hook it up to your car or wall so if you run out of  batteries you can use that. To top it all off, it costs alot less than  those other things on the list and comes with more. I really recommend  this!"
5,"This is a BEEFY cable. I've never used a braided cable before, so when we got it, I was definitely shocked at its thickness. However it's done very well, we've not had a single issue while using it. The picture quality is great (yes, some HDMI cables CAN be bad: do your research, people!), it's stood up well against a bit of abuse moving the computer around the house, and when I need a new cable for the TV, I'm going to be buying another one very soon. If you're reading this review, I absolutely recommend this cable in particular!"
5,"The IM-237 Orbit speakers provides very good sound with a wide dynamic range - from a tiny speaker in a package about the size of an orange.  Great for presentations - you don't have to lug big speakers with you - or listening on an ipod.  Far bigger, deeper sound than the built in speakers in my 17\\"" Macbook pro.  If you are expecting this little device to sound like your home stereo system you'll be disappointed.  But the compromise of small size, portability, low price and very acceptable sound makes the iM-237 Orbit well worth it.  Battery life is OK.  The cord wraps nicely around the base and the mini-plug stores into a recessed area on the base.  However, at only 6\\"" long, it is maddeningly short.  Minor flaws aside,   this is a very good product at a reasonable price."
5,Great cable nicely built and works great
5,"Thank you for this PRODUCT Was a good BUY .Such obvious tips but often we forget. Ive downloaded the free e-book (THANK YOU!). Just read the first chapter about visualising the ideal customer. I thought I was quite clear in my head about who that was  but then when Henneke asked What keeps this person up at night?, What car do they drive?  made me think perhaps I dont know this person as well as I should. I am going to take her advice and draw out my two ideal customers and then imagine myself writing to them as suggested. Thanks Team!<br /><br />BEST S"
5,"Solid & Thick cables provide true High Fidelity on a latest Dennon Receiver and Polk Audio speakers,<br />I have setup a home surround sound system along with a Samsung LCD 52&#34; and a Sony PS3, and I couldn't be much happier."
1,It worked great for about a week.  Then it got stuck on the start up screen.  I've sent it back and haven't got the refund yet...
5,Was exactly what I was needing.
5,"At the beginning, I set the master volume in 30 (out of 60), and nothing happens.  So I decided to read the manual and set some functions ...<br />One hour later, everything is ok.  Clean sound, good product quality, excellent price.<br />Want more functions?  Expend more money."
5,The protector is solid for the price. It seems substantial. Lets hope it does its job when the fateful event occurs.
5,I use the 50' hdmi to connect my 60&#34; tv to my computer.am surprised how sharp the picture is because I was expecting some loss do to the length of the cable and because of the size of the TV.I did have a problem after 9 months with it but the seller quickly sent me a replacement after I contacted them.would recommend and buy again from them.at most stores you will pay this price for a 10' or 12' cable .this one has a braided cover and appears well made
1,"Bought this adapter to replace the old one that goes to my Acer netbook, since it was about half of what others sold for. I got it about 3 or 4 days after placing my order. It only worked one time, and refused to after that. I asked for a replacement, but was refused and could only get a refund.<br /><br />STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.<br /><br />UPDATE: I received a replacement unit from the seller a couple of months ago and have been using it daily. no problems. I'm satisfied."
2,Large speaker with little sound. There would be a number of cheaper solutions to get the sound you get from these.
4,"For the price I am very impressed with these earbuds. However the main reason I bought them was for the gym. When you have the earbuds in, you honestly cannot hear anything around you which is not good at a crowded gym. I do like using them at work where I can have it in one ear. Very comfortable and doesn't bug you at all by wearing it for 8 hours."
5,"CNET raved about these headphones.  I'm going to get another pair.  Just afraid they are going to start jacking up the price.  Listening to Keb Mo' on my MacBook Air, and I'm hearing sounds in the music I haven't heard before.  I've listened to these sounds thousands of times.  I expect this for $100+, but now $6.87 including shipping!!!!!!!  I'm not a huge deal shopper, but I happened to get a great deal of these.  So, I'd still be this happy if I paid $20."
5,"I tried soo many brands as I ride a motorcycle and I bust my ear buds all the time.  So I can tell you the BEST quality I have ever experienced and still do is the brand Wicked.  I buy the $10 version of Wicked ear buds and they sound as great as the $100 version of ear buds from other name brands.  They also have a great bass, sound quality is superior but if you want to spend on the $20 version for Wicked it's what you would expect out of ear buds for that price and much more bass and decibel intensity. Yes, the cords seem not to be the best but the sound quality is astounding!  Can't emphasize enough after trying 30 other brands, none even come close to these ear buds, including $100 name brand ear buds!  You will be especially satisfied if you listen to heavy metal or ebm or techno  ^_^"
5,ran HDMI cables in wall to mounted flat panel tv and used these connectors to create wall connections so i could avoid visible cables running down my wall.
5,"THIS MOUNT IS GREAT!! I INSTALLED IT IN ABOUT 30 MINUTES. IT IS VERY STURDY AND HOLDS MY 40 TV WITH EASE. ALL HARDWARE WAS SUPPLIED AND I HAD LOTS LEFT OVER. IT HAS WAY MORE ADJUSTMENT THAN I WILL EVER NEED. THANKS AGAIN. MIKE C. CAPE CORAL, FL."
4,"The device works well from Sony Playstation to ViewSonic PJD5133 projector on an eleven foot screen. Perfect home theater. Of course, the audio connection to the surround sound system is wired. We will try to connect audio via Bluetooth transmitter & receiver using separate boxes. Belkin should build Bluetooth audio, with an additional receiver, into a future system to get all five stars."
5,Great Ear buds. Comfortable and light weight. The cord is plenty long enough. And the right angle plug in is nice too. And a nice clear sound As well They have a great high frequency rage. And the mids and lows are responsive.  All in all well balanced EQ. Off the record these are not a bunch of S@#T like the crap at Wal Mart. These actually sound really good for once. Just saying. :)
5,"Purchased for my kids, they love them! They claim the sound is great. I have not tried them, but the kids are happy with them."
5,"This is a high drain  protected rechargeable li-ion battery, by  Firefox mobile . This rechargeable battery was integrated 3 discharging protection circuit for safe use.A discharge rate performance with no memory effects. I found this battery to work great,it worked in my charger .It kept the charge for a long time , and all around is it great rechargeable battery.I usually like to have my reviews longer but I really don't know a lot to say about a rechargeable battery other than it worked well and did its job .<br /><br />I recommend this battery, I receive this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review"
4,Excellent value for free hanging projection screen.
5,Nice secure mount to the receptacle. Very convenient to have the USB ports ready instead of hunting for the charge adapter!
5,Easy to Bluetooth ; good volume love it
3,Needs some tweeking
1,"Never got the product. Not sure what happened, but ordered this thinking the micro mini would work with my tablet and external keyboard."
5,the light on the end of the cable is extremely useful when you have 5 devices connecting to a AV receiver. cannot beat the price.
4,"These headphones have a warm, non-fatiguing sound.  Maybe the best sound I have found for the price.<br />Physically, they did get a little tiring.<br />I would rate them 5 stars except for build quality.  The design, while the speaker-housings are strong & made of stainless-steel, the rest of the product cannot keep up with the sturdiness of the earbuds.  The cable is not on parr, & separated from the mic/remote in the first week of use.  Also, they were a little unwieldy, more so than other similarly shaped headphones I've owned... I think this is due to the weight of the earbuds in relationship to the cables.<br /><br />If their primary use will be super gentle, I do recommend these... they sound amazing & the RHA people are helpful & honer the 3 year warranty.  They sent me another pair before asking me to send my first pair back!"
1,"I recieved the Zen Micro as a present and although I had never heard of it, I was excited to get a new MP player, and even more excited to get one that played 2,500 songs.   <br />After recieving it, it took about an hour to download the software onto my computer and then 7 hours to fill my player with songs and create albulm for them.  With the Creative media player that installs on your computer and takes over as the primary media player wether you want it to or not, the process of uploading music involves moving track by track and about a minute per song.   <br /> <br />After getting about 800 songs on the player it was full, what Zen only writes in very fine print is that the player holds 2,500 WMPAs, which I had none of.  Still excited to have a small player to put in my pocket on the treadmill, I headed out to the gym.  After less than two minutes the player was broken. I tried rebooting it acording to the intructions, this involved awkwardly pulling out the battery and hitting some buttons, nothing happened. Also some of the aptions in the rebooting menu that pops up an not only wipe out your music, but wipe out all the firmware on the player, and because of the desighn of the virticle touch pad, accidently hitting on of these options is all too easy. <br /> <br />On the phone with Creative, they said they would replace it.  Since my player was bought off of Amazon during the holiday season and I did not get it until two months later it was too late to return it to Amazon.   <br /> <br />A month later I recieved my replacement.  Again after spending the good part of the morning and early afternoon uploading my music, I headed off to work with my new player in hand.  Then it happened again, this time I was running to catch the city bus when the player froze.  Again nothing happened when I tried to reboot it. <br /> <br />Creative replaced it again becuase that was all they could do, they refuse to give me any type of refund. <br />I just recieved my third Zenmicro yesterday, oddly enough it arrived on the same day as my new IPod mini.  The ipod took less than an hour to download the software (itunes)which had a much better interface even on my PC. Another hour later, itunes had uploaded 1,000 songs as promised to my IPod, which has proven to work wonderfully walking around, riding the subway, catching the bus, and yes working out at the gym.  Also the circular pad is much easier to use tha the vertical pad of the Zen.  The rebooting process also only involves hitting one button as opposed to opening up the player and giving yourself the oppertunity to wreck the whole thing. <br /> <br />Six months after first using the Zen Micro I am now happily part of the MP player carrying community with my new IPod mini.  All I can say is that it's on top for a reason."
1,"A good concept, unfortunately does not appear to work with either LG G3, or even the Droid Mini.  Used the cable with the G3 as well as with the Mini on multiple TV units, but no luck!  Have returned the unit.  It appears that the connectivity is limited to specific units of mobile phones.  Check for compatibility before ordering."
1,"I bought this internet security suite because of the attractive price, features, and reviews, but when I installed it on my new Dell Inspiron 531, it slowed everything on my machine to an unbearable crawl. Since nothing seemed to alleviate the problem, I followed the instructions to uninstall it. When I booted up afterwards, my machine was still painfully slow. Putting the computer in safe mode, I discovered that the CA program files were still loaded and could not be deleted. After many hours of frustration, I finally managed to contact tech support online, and someone in India took control of my computer and finally was able to get the software totally off my machine. Right after that, my speed was back to normal. Given the frustration and time wasted on this software, I would never recommend it to anyone."
5,"Compact, nice red color"
4,my son loves this. the sound quality is great didn't expect it to come with the ear piece which was a big plus for me
5,"This product is fantastic.  I tried one of those flat, window mount devices but the reception was spotty.  I live in a major metro area and I knew I should be able to get better reception.  It took me about 15 minutes to assemble and about 30 minutes to mount to my old Dish network mount on the roof of my home.  The reception is awesome.  I now get 55 channels, all clearer than my cable or dish service ever got them.  I know some people said the antenna is &#34;flimsy&#34; but all outside antennas are light weight.  I guess a lot of folks have forgotten the old outside antennas from the 50s, 60s and 70s before cable, but they were all light weight aluminium.<br />Just be sure to ground them and clamp them tightly to your mounting pole.  It is a real joy to watch these channels now at no monthy expense. (P S) I have tried the motor driven part and found four more channels so I am up to nearly 60 channels."
5,Nice speaker ! Good Sound and compact. Thank you !
3,"The clock has a number of advantages, but please note that the instructions specify to remove the batteries if you use the power adapter. In other words, if you were expecting a clock that normally used wall power but would keep time during a long power outage, this isn't the one you want, at least if you follow the directions. In the clock's favor, however, I noticed that the clock kept the time for a couple of seconds after unplugging it, so it looks like a momentary power glitch wouldn't bother it.<br /><br />Also, I found it difficult to program the clock without the instructions in front of me.<br /><br />On the positive side, I liked the electronic tuning and the fact that the clock display doesn't glow during the night. (Better for sleeping, according to one sleep expert I recently heard.)"
5,love them perfect
1,"I wasn't able to test this component prior to going on my cruise because I don't have anything in my home that uses RCA cables; BUT, I wish I had!  I brought this on a cruise to use a WD Live TV with the tv in my suite.  Other than a buzzing sound, I received nothing; no picture, no clear audio, just buzzing."
1,"nice idea, bad tape. They will fall and also the hole is very small, many cables wont pass thru.<br />use a black paper clamp instead, work perfect."
1,"Ha've bought 2 identical units in recent months, and they were identical, neither worked out of the package, my recommendation would be not to buy!!!!"
5,very good for the value
3,good product but placement of slots is still too close to plug in some bulky plugs
5,"I was dealing with bad insomnia for the past few months, and my efforts to wake earlier (so I'd be tired enough to sleep earlier) were not helped by me constantly sleeping through my alarm. I was looking for a clock with a few specific functions: 1. It had to have a gradual wake feature, as the shock from normal alarm clocks always left me groggy in the morning, 2. It had to be able to use some kind of nature sound as the alarm, simply because it's more pleasant to wake up to those than it is to a beep, and 3. It had to be lit with cool blue LED lights, because this is less jarring to look at at night, and the blue is more soothing to look at than the normal red LEDs, which just look ugly to me.<br /><br />It was really impressed with how many sounds there were on the clock (20), I didn't expect it to have that many. I've never heard the earlier model so I can't comment if the clarity was better with those, but the sounds are fine to use as an alarm. They are definitely not clear enough to use as a sound machine or sound soother; there is a lot of noise, like the sounds were recorded through a cheap microphone, or possibly the speakers are cheap. But since I did not buy the alarm clock to listen to, and just use it as an alarm, it personally did not matter to me.<br /><br />Some of the sounds are also pretty clear. I like to use the wind chimes sound as my alarm, since it's a gentle way to wake up, and the sound clarity is better than some of the other sounds like the ocean or the brook.<br /><br />It's very easy and straightforward to navigate the clock menus and set up the alarm. You can also program 2 alarms, which is a nice bonus! And you can set each alarm to go off everyday, every weekday, or every weekend day. I was impressed with how many features the clock was programmed with.<br /><br />My insomnia is also a lot better now, and this clock looks great on my blue desk! It had an unobtrusive yet slick and modern design, and the numbers have 3 levels of brightness that are all aesthetically pleasing. There is also a daylight savings time button on the back of the clock, so you can adjust that with the flick of a finger instead of programming it through the clock buttons manually.<br /><br />I am happy with my purchase and glad I bought it despite the negative reviews. :) There really wasn't any other alarm clock on Amazon that fit my criteria, and if they did they cost over $100 and there was no way I was paying that much for an alarm clock, so I'm relieved that the one clock that is reasonably priced turned out to be better than what I had been expecting."
5,This mediabridge 3.5mm cable works very well with excellent sound quality. I replace the cable come with my speaker to this one. Now the sound quality is much better. No complain.
5,It works very well!
5,"I read almost all the reviews and agree with most of what's said.  But I have a warning. First, my story. I bought this gadget to listen to and record the old albums I last heard back in the 80's.  So I dug out my old Sony PS-X600 turntable (high end in its day), made all the connections to my home theater system, cued up \\""Innervision\\"" (by Stevie Wonder), and let rip.  AWFUL!  Sound quality was terrible!<br /><br />I started going through everything trying to find the problem.  After all, I was an audiophile back in the day and I should have the know-how to troubleshoot this mess.  Well, I found it.  The moving magnet style M97 Shure cartridge, which was high end in its day, was shot.  I replaced it with a new one (got a great deal here on Amazon), and then WOW I got blown away by Stevie singing \\""Superstition.\\"" Then I cranked up Pat Benatar, then Spyro Gyra then Chicago Transit Authority. All sounded fantabulous!<br /><br />For all you baby boomers out there, the warning is this  -- just because your turntable spins the record it still might need a new cartridge or a new stylus.  The sensitive internal stylus parts degrade and deteriorate over time even if you never use the turntable.  So if you buy this Art Preamp and the sound quality sucks, check your cartridge, people!"
5,These gifts are purchased with funds raised by a school for a boys home. we collect money and fulfill the boys specific holiday wishes. With Amazon prime I am able to grant the boys wishes with ease and in a timely manner. Thanks for offering such a quick delivery service
4,i like it.
4,"Well, lots of people talked about how excellent the sound was, and it is quite good quality, but the treble is rather high & the bass far too low for my tastes; It makes my music a bit less enjoyable, though I don't notice a difference when it's just people talking. Also as others mentioned, it shipped SO FAST. Ridiculously fast, coming from Japan! And it was very carefully packaged & even came with a pleasant little note from the senders. They are also SO light & quite comfortable (more so than my current Sony ear-clips). But, the sound was a trifle disappointing."
2,"Sound quality is good, and noise shield is good. You know you are talking about in-ear headphone, so set the bar low.<br />Easy to fall out from your ear, especially during work out."
4,"I love it, but it should have come with touch up paint the doors on the front have worn off some of the finish. Easy fix, but still...looks great!"
5,"For the price of these headphones, they are great. They aren't the best quality, but they are my favorite because they fit perfectly into my ears and are really convenient. I have these in practically every color."
5,"Was just what I ordered, fast service too. Just wish they would have had more in stock at time of purchase."
2,"I've had this adapter for almost a month and when I first bought it it worked great. Now when I plug it into the computer the light on the adapter blinks, and the light around the part where you plug the charger into the computer also blinks and it no longer charges. This and a lot of the adapter sold on amazon are a complete waste of money."
5,"Good manufacturing quality, and it's a Genuine Tripp-Lite product. I've used it to plug my Raspberry Pi to my old DVI monitor.<br /><br />Be sure to buy this directly from Amazon and not from somebody else that uses the Amazon Fulfillment, otherwise you could get a fake!"
2,"Relatively inexpensive, ~$15. I find they have very good sound. They come with 2 sets of silicone adapters. One set is HUGE, the other still big. I'm a six foot tall man and they loosen from the ear canal when walking. Kids, like my son, will loose the silicone tips and then there's no replacement available, rendering them useless. If it weren't for excellent sound quality, I'd have given them 1 Star."
3,Thankyou much!
5,"I was provided this antenna free for an honest review.  It just so happened I was in desperate need.<br /><br />I have not had cable for about 5 years now.  It was just getting ridiculous.  So, like many others, I bought an antenna to get local channels.  I tried three or four antennas of various cost, and it was always chopping and crappy.  I could never get a solid digital signal.  I gave up on ever seeing my local channels again.<br /><br />This antenna, on the other hand, is totally different.  It has a pretty good range on its own (despite being paper thin), but it also has a signal booster.  It is powered by USB if you have a USB port on your TV (most TVs have this, and it says &#34;for service only,&#34; but it works great); if not, there is a little power adapter you can also attach.  The cords are all nice and long.<br /><br />With this antenna, I am getting channels I didn't even know existed in the area.  My local channels are clear as can be, no choppiness at all, and I get the public channels as well.  I'm thrilled!  I had given up on ever seeing them again, but now I have them, for free, with this antenna, which works where other antennas totally failed me."
3,"These discs are great, but for the Mavica recomended cameras that use them, I continue to get disc errors with the Sony brand. Though I do have to say, they are much cheaper than the Mavica's. I will continue to use them whether or not I get errors, because of their price... I just hope I don't lose too many pics from it."
5,Combined with free shipping makes this site worth buying these from. Shipment came very prompt as well.
5,"easy to put together and the level is actually accurate.  I have it holding up my 40&#34; Samsung TV. it's not a heavy TV, but I like the quality of it."
4,"Works very well in czech republic, hungary and austria.  When we got to Switzerland the hotels we stayed at had only one plug that it would work in(the plug where the TV was plugged in).  All the rest of the plugs were either recessed diamond shaped and too small for the adapter or the prong holes were too small for the adapter.  We unplugged the TV for one and utilized our power convert with small prongs for other chargers.  Two in one function was excellent as we had 3 cameras, one video camera,a tablet and an I-touch that needed charging(electronics you get when you take kids with you). They had to stay in touch with their friends via facebook every night."
2,"I've had two pairs of these (one broke, and was replaced by sony), and I had probably 3 pairs of an earlier model of the same headphone. On all models, including the one I'm wearing right now. One earbud broke.    They sound great and are extremely comfortable, but consider yourself lucky if they last more than a few month"
3,I have the same bottle left over from the 80's which is made in the USA. No big surprise the new one is made in China. Works as expected
5,"Much thinner than the zutcharger.  I can fit this charger, the usb cable that came with the headphones, the audio cable, and a spare battery all in the little zipper pouch in the Zik hard case.<br /><br />From totally dead battery (plugged into 2012 13&#34; macbook pro usb 2.0 port) to fully charged in 2.5 hrs.  Nice overcharge protection (green light comes on when charged). Nice red &#34;breathing&#34; pulse when charging.  Overall, I would DEFINITELY recommend this product!"
5,There are a lot of options and I still have not figured out how to use most of them. Great receiver.
5,"I just received my Grace Tuner the other day, and I must say, this is an AWESOME product. I have been looking into various internet radios, namely the Squeezebox, and did not see anything that looked like it met my needs. When I saw the Grace Tuner and found out I could get internet radio stations, Pandora, and stream my MP3's from my NAS drive, with audio coming through my stereo, I had to try it out. I have the product installed using ethernet because I keep my router with my home theatre equipment (for PS3, XBOX 360, and Kaleidescape) so I cannot speak to the Wifi but every review I have read says the Wifi works great. From the moment I powered it up, it has worked flawlessly. I have located several local radio stations, setup my Pandora account to stream to the Tuner, and connected my Cisco NAS 200 box to stream my MP3 collection. I am using my iPhone as a remote, which is a great FREE feature for this device. The LCD screen, as many have said, is not that detailed, but it is clear and bright. My only gripe would be that when scanning through my 50GB of MP3's, I have to scroll through all the artists or albums to get to the one I want, so if I want to listen to Warren Zevon I have to scroll from the A's to the W's. Would be awesome if the iPhone APP had a search by letter feature for your files. Other than that, this is a great product and probably one of the best purchases I have made in the past few years."
5,Perfect - works as advertised and is much less expensive than similar name-brand wire.  Would definitely buy again.
5,"The headphones are great for the gym.  They block out all noises very well and provide amazing sound for you.  Plus, I've treated mine pretty rough and they are still working wonderfully."
5,Great cable for the price. Same cable at Best Buy was over triple the cost of this one. Sturdy connectors and nice construction!
5,La Crosse Battery Charger is a very good product.  However the charging time is a bit long in general.
5,"I've had a few different wall mounts and this one is my favorite.  I've spent close to $100 before and have been much more happy with this unit.  I have 3 17\\"" monitors mounted over my desk and these guys work great!<br /><br />Every once in a while a monitor will tilt down as it gets a little loose, but the allen wrench they supply tightens it back up again.  great motion and tilt.  Quality product at a great price I highly recommend it"
3,"The clip on glasses are flimsy, one pair already broke, and the smaller children's size, one of them the lens' came out, and one of the adult pairs also fell apart easily."
5,These shelves are perfect for dvds or old vhs tapes or even paperback books. We replaced the feet with smaller versions and linked 2 units together (with zip ties) as well as anchored to wall. Working out great.
5,"I've been an audiophile for over 40 years and these headphones deliver as much value as one can expect for the price.  Very nice sound reproduction over the listed frequency range and for all kinds of different music/instruments.  The headphone design turns the earpices direcly in toward the ear canal in order to deliver more sound to the inner ear instead of around the outer ear.  Very comfortable foam earpads that don't cause ear fatigue over several hours of listening.  The only downside is the length of the cable.  I use my phones for my computer at work and a 6' or longer cable would be nice.  The 4.5' cable length should be fine for iPods or other portable devices, though.  Buy 'em, you won't be disappointed."
4,Haven't used it much but sound is better than I thought it would be seems like good quality  and was easy to set up
4,"I won't rehash all of the previous reviews.  If you want more features be aware that this stripped out a lot of the stuff that's unnecessary for exercise.    Also sort of a downer for me is that cover flow is not enabled on this new generation of nano.  Otherwise it's great for what it's meant to be.    Does flap around on your sleeve while exercising, unlike an armband."
1,"Just bought a brand new panasonic passive 3d tv to replace an old sony in which we were still  using a converter box. Don't have cable, never have, never will. Anyhow, decided to buy a new antenna. My husband picked up this model @ Home Depot and its junk.<br />When we first installed it, couldn't even pick up channel 49(ION) Had to rescan at least 6 times. Every time you change channels, you have to get up and fiddle with the antenna, I mean everytime! If you're on 26(FOX), flip to 49(ION), antenna won't even pick it up, screen goes black and tells me channel is unavilable. If you're on 49 and flip to a major channel like CBS/NBC/ABC, picture continuously pixilates, sound goes in and out, so jump up and fiddle with the antenna. What's the point of remote control if you have to keep jumping up to move the antenna? Sometimes I just give up and turn it off. I've tried putting it in the window, turning it upside down, horizontal,vertical, antenna all the way up,half way down, all the way down and I only live about 12.7 miles from most of the major towers with no tall obstacles in the way! A couple of them are around 17 miles away, but those aren't the stations I have trouble with.<br />We have a 4 yo HD Magnavox in the bedroom, using a 4 yo,$5 Dollar store loop antenna that gets better reception than this amplified, optimized HDTV GE antenna does. I'd give it a minus 0, if I could. Guess we'll put our old 6 yo antenna back on tomorrow. Good thing we kept it."
2,Didn't read there was no inline volume control. Sound quality just ok but what do you expect for a mere $25?
5,Bought this Iphone charger for my husband. SO much nicer than<br />having to put a plug into it. I will buy another when this charger goes out!
4,"Through and through, a good HDMI cable. It has a nice thick cord that I don't worry about it breaking, and it has a pretty good reach."
5,"Plug and go for my daughter's Saturn.  Connected right up to her iPhone 5.  Now, off at college, she has a check engine light and can read the code to find out how serious the problem is."
4,I have 5 of these HDMI's and have had zero problems with them. Only issue I have had is a slight hiccup between my comcast cable box and tv. Cuts to black about 4-5 times an hour. Seems like the box doesn't like this cable as it works on everything else.
5,"This is the lamp replacement I needed for my Sony TV.  Glad it works!  Missed not having a TV for a few weeks until I figured out what the problem was.  Delivery was good, would have been better if there wasn't a problem on MY end!!"
5,"Great product to have if you have an older (read 1976) stereo unit that only has one &#34;aux in&#34; jack in the back. You can plug up to five different devices (turntable, cd player, tv, Sirius radio adapter, etc.) into this and use the sixth one to plug into the aux in jack. Works like a champ, and brings your older stereo into the Space Age!"
4,"I bought this a few moths ago and must say am very pleased with the sound quality, considering the low price.  The iPad app also works well, except the FM tuner isn't the greatest, but that's not why I bought it.  I usually end up carrying it around the house and outside like a \\""boom-box\\"" and leave my iPad in one room (when my son or wife aren't playing games on it), and can still control the music using the little remote that stores nicely in a compartment in the bottom of the unit.  They are also very responsive to customer comments/questions/etc... Excellent customer service.  Overall, I am very happy with this item."
1,totally the wrong product. I guess it may be my fault but I have never seen anything that it would work with in the USA.
4,This seems to be a good product. I bought it for my father and he seems to love it. Right now he has it mounted in the attic and it takes a minute for it to pick up channels but he said that he going to mount it on the roof of the house because he thinks that it would perform even better. Thanks amazon!!
5,"I use it in my fairly noisy car and I'm able to hear it loud and clear with decent bass. Of course the quality is just a notch below my desktop Harman Kardon 06941V speakers when it comes to bass and sharpness, but is louder than the desktop speakers."
1,"Just returned this radio. It couldn't receive one station on any band clearly.  Its built like an 8.00 radio not the 80.00 radio i was paying for and expecting.  Earphones were cheap. Radio rattled as if something large were loose in it, and like i said before...couldnt pick up one station without static.  Buyer Beware!"
5,"Great little clock.  I bought 2 others (not Sonys) and returned them before ordering this one.  The sound quality of the Sony is far superior to others I tried.  I love the dimming of the time feature.  I have not tried the projection of the time feature because if I wake up in the middle of the night I don't want to see it.  It is easy to set the alarms, and I have one set for weekdays and one for weekends.  I'm very happy with this clock radio!"
4,"I bought these about a year ago, and they are as VERY good head phones.. they do block out most sound and the quality is VERY GOOD. Good bass and gets loud. They are light weight and durable.  Beats by Dre are better sound and appearl quality, but for the money you cannot lose on this...<br /><br />The only that i personally didn't like was the way they looked.. comparing them to beats, they're not as stylish. . Other than black or grey, all the colors we ugly to me. And I didn't care for the controls on the headphones.<br /><br />Outdoor tech, do have earbuds available, however I'm not sure how good they are.. if they are anything close to the quality of the privates, I'll be getting those as well.<br /><br />Good luck!"
5,"I own several of these lights. Keep one in each vehicle, fishing tackle box and survival pack. They are tough and sturdy and the greatest thing is they only take ONE AAA battery. Love to night fish and they stay in place on the bill of your cap. Great for changing lures and tying knots."
4,Good DVD for the money.
1,"If you're using Napster 2.0 (the legal one) don't bother buying this product.  You'd think from the description (supports wma files) that it would be easy to do but they don't support drm wma.  DRM is Microsoft's way to control the industry and moving a drm wma file to iRiver entails first burning it to a CD, then copying it over to the iRiver device.  What a total pain-in-the-$#%.<br />Good luck figuring out iRiver.  You have to download firmware and driver updates with instructions written by somebody with a clear lack of understanding of the english language.  I've spent 20 years in the computer industry and am a PC expert - but the iRiver support staff was nasty, implying that it was MY FAULT that their system didn't work!  Unbelievable."
3,"I like the software and functionality of this device, but by just barely bumping the cord caused severe static to the recording. There was something loose inside on the circuit board. I didn't give the seller the opportunity to replace it because of time and importance at this time. So, for this reason reason I rated it &#34;OKay&#34;. The product was packaged nicely and came at a reasonable time."
5,Excellent for the price
5,This TV stand for wall was exactly as stated and works well for us. It is a solid piece and very secure on wall. I would recommend this for wal mounting your YV as it has worked well for us.
5,Item was as described and my wife loved it for the color and the size being nice and compact and held alot if music storage this iPod replaced an older broken model she had it was a good birthday present
4,Reception is good.  Easy to operate. sound quality is good for such a small unt. Travel mode is a good feature.  Needs a car charger. Battery life is short on the first charge(less than 24 hours)but gets better on the second and consecutive charges.  Three second delay on the power button and beep when a button is pressed are very anoying features.  You need a microscope to read the manual.  It does the job for the price.
5,Good one. the quality of plastic seems to be good
5,"I bought this mainly for the charger but could always use some more batteries.  The charger is nice, has the best charge light indication I have seen in any LiIon charger.  I like that the charger can charge many sizes and types of batteries, I have tested and it worked great!  If you don't buy this combo you should look for this charger separately, it's worth it.<br /><br />Some batteries sold as 18650 LiIon batteries don't have a large enough button at the top to make contact on many devices.  These batteries don't have that problem and they work in everything I have tried them on.  I use them mainly for flashlights but work in laser pointer as well.  I haven't tested the batteries for claimed charge, but they do last longer than any lower rated 18650s that I have so they do last well.<br /><br />Lastly the price for the combo here is great, I couldn't find a better deal.  I would highly recommend this combo."
4,Small thing produces huge impact.  Only took this to convert my iPhone to a TV that now gives me NetFlix..
4,The best ?
5,"Works great for me. Saw my signal strengths boosted by an average of 20 to 30 points on the 0 to 100 scale. I am using an attic fractal antenna and am 27 to 46 miles from transmitters. However, I also receive signals from two transmitters 103 miles away - one station all the time and the other about 75% of the time. That's 18 transmitters providing 50 digital channels. Hook up was very easy. I plan on adding a distribution amplifier to my other sets and then cutting the cord with cable. I should add that my TV shows max signal on several channels, but they never seem to be overloaded as the picture and voice are perfect."
1,"Completely misleading. It's not an auto set clock. Mine wasn't set, and is so cheap I can't even set the time. Piece of junk!"
5,"Right now, we use only 2 Splitters - ViewHD 2 Port 1x2 Powered HDMI Mini Splitter & OREI HD-102 1x2 1 Port HDMI Powered Splitter. They work! And appear to be the same Device, different paint job. We're always looking for HDMI Splitters. As long as these work, no need to get firmware hacked HDFury HDMI Splitters from China. BTW: All of this gear is made in China. Anyway...  This ViewHD 2 Port 1x2 Powered HDMI Mini Splitter can also be Rack Mounted. We've found 2 ways - Compression Shelf or DIN Rail Mounts. The Rack Mount Compression Shelf is less expensive. We currently use Middle Atlantic OCAP-2 2U Vented Clamping Rack Shelf.  We have 4 HDMI Splitters Rack Mounted and wired into an HDMI Patch Panel. We can reconfigure, on the fly, for whatever a Presentation requires. Getting Power to 4 HDMI Splitters was more difficult. Solution: USB Power! Using Cargis 6 Port USB Charger & StarTech 3 foot USB to Type M Barrel 5V DC Power Cables. Works! Hope this helps!"
5,Best headset you will find under $100... period. highs are crisp and the Bass is clear. Really nice sound.
1,Broke in a month.  Don't buy.
5,"like most 20something year olds... i'm obsessed with taking photos. especially straight-on self portraits or ones of myself and friends all trying to desperately squeeze our faces close enough together that we'll all be in the picture. <br />thank goodness for being able to digitally delete and redo! <br />i really can't count how many photos i've taken that aren't capturing anything more than less than flattering angles of only parts of people's faces. <br />we're all familiar with extending our arms as far out as we can and snapping the pic, then quickly clicking to view what ends up being only everyone's forehead. <br />how i didn't think of this invention first.. pains me, financially. but, i am happy to give my 30 bucks to the real mastermind. <br />it's awesome, truly. <br />you can extend it out far enough to completely capture everyone's entire face. <br />and once you REALLY get the hang of it... you can include some background in there. great for scenic vacations! or slyly getting that hot guy behind you in the picture, too. <br />it also seems totally plausible that you could just extend it straight up and over everyone's head in crowds to get decent pics at concerts and such! <br />everyone that's seen me use it comments on how ingenious it is, and i couldn't agree more!"
5,great quality control.very few &#34;coasters&#34;
5,Just what I ordered.<br />works great.
4,seems to work well
3,"OK, to the defense of this product, the instructions leave little hope that this will increase your watching pleasure with a long sort of disclaimer that you need to have a signal to amplify a signal, and the amp can also amplify interference and actually make your signal WORSE...so wtf is the POINT if you can already see a channel? It is, however, a nicely made heavy piece of metal equipment but I think it will only work in the flatlands.<br /><br />I'm hanging on to it to try a different config. and installation.  Currently, I'm running it between an attic mounted DIY DTV antenna and 1 TV.  That works great for a handful of channels we can get in the mountainous terrain here.  I am going to add TVs and will need the splitter for that - good but not work another star.  I hope to get more channels when I get my antenna up higher outside the house and grounded for lightning and all that.<br /><br />MEH..."
5,"Cheap and easy to use. We traveled to Asia, Africa and Europe, and it worked perfectly everywhere we went! No problems, it was perfect. I'm saving it for my next trip!"
3,This is a mediocre player in terms of sound quality. My ancient Cowon U2 blows away the Sansa View when it comes to sound. I wish I had purchased another player.
5,Hard to find item that I needed to get my fax going.
5,"My company actually sells various tv mounts and installs them. I like these mounts much better than anything we carry. Very sturdy, easy to install, inconspicuous, great angling without loss of structural integrity. Excellent product and hdmi cable is great quality."
5,Easy
5,This item shipped very quick and was just what we needed! Thank you!
5,it held all my dvds I had on this deployment. originally ordered another item that was needed but took too long to get here so ordered this one instead. happy with the switch and it did it's job and the price wasn't too bad
4,Haven't had them long but I've been trying to put them in my ears every chance I get. I have noticed the bass level is nice and the highs are kind on nice too. I'm glad that I did not buy the JBD3's and they fit well. I would recommend these to anyone at the present time. worth the money.<br /><br />PS the cancel a lot of out side noise!!
4,"They sound decent. The M&M earbuds look sweet and cute in the ears.  Everyone who see knows the classic candy trademark - unique.<br /><br />If you want to give it as a gift, just remember the packet is small and is more like a stocking stuffer than a regular present.  The packet stands approximately three inches tall."
2,"Use caution when ordering, if you don't buy the item from Amazon itself.  The vendors selling the \\""same\\"" item for significantly less are likely to just send you a bag of generic jacks, not the nice C2G ones with the load bars.  I was able to get a refund from the vendor and I'm probably going to go ahead and use the jacks anyway, but it wasn't what I had hoped to receive."
4,"This speaker produces great sound for its size.  I was also surprised at the microphone clarity when having a phone conversation with the built in Mic.  Minimal muffle, minimal echo."
4,"I have four of these speakers. Of those four, one is defective. The volume isn't as loud as the other three speakers, but if you tinker with the volume wheel you can eventually get it to sound as loud as the others, considering you don't touch the volume wheel or move the speaker too much. From this, just know that there's a small chance you'll get a defective speaker. I cannot comment on return policy since the defective one was a gift.    Of the ones that do work, expect surprisingly loud sound. Turn your MP3 player, iPhone, etc. to max volume and turn the speaker to max volume and, trust me on this, you will be surprised by how loud this little speaker is. Plus, it has its own headphone jack to plug into your music player, phone, etc. so you don't need a separate one. All you need to do to charge is to plug it into your computer's USB with the included cable and the battery lasts a long time. I also like how if you buy two or more you can connect them to each other to play music through all connected speakers. I really recommend this speaker for gifts. I take it everywhere I go."
2,"I bought these as a mothers day present, and while they sounded decent when initially used, they started getting a lot of static after a few days and stopped playing after about a week.  They shouldn't have blown out either, since the volume was not very high.  I sought out an Altec Lansing IM5 as a replacement present, which works very well."
5,"Have had the Dash for almost 4 years now and it's still running strong.  It's been the greatest alarm clock, iPhone charger, Netflix viewer, and Pandora player ever.  Sure, button presses are slow and there hasn't been a firmware update since who knows when, but it still works amazingly well."
1,cd player didn't work
2,It didn't work as well as I hoped...
4,"These are pretty good headphones and the mic works really well. My only complaint is that the headphones don't stay on too well. They keep sliding off the top of my head. I've tried adjusting them, but it doesn't help."
5,Works great
5,good backup battery
4,"It works fine, but every now and then it has trouble connecting to my laptop. This could be that I have a 3-4 year old laptop so I'm not fully blaming the cord. Most stores had the same cord for $80-$100 so I am totally happy with this one!!!!!  :D"
4,"I purchased Philips Fidelio AS351/37 Bluetooth Speaker Dock few weeks ago and started using it as soon as i received it. It is nice and just the right size for the side table. I did not have a problem connecting my SG3 to the unit via bluetooth. I also love how you can use 4-AA batteries as a power source, but i never really have to use batteries since it is my room plugged in all the time. The thing I do not like is the silky net that covers the speakers. Over time the net can collect dusts, and it is not something you can take off to clean. But overall, I am very satisfied with the item"
5,"All things considered, while electronics are getting more advanced, having this protection is almost a requirement in the event of a system malfunction. It offers a great peace of mind and back up in the event needed."
2,Headphones were &#34;as advertised&#34; but very uncomfortable compared to others in this price range
4,"Works exactly as I expected it to, nice and small too. Update: After almost a year of use it's still holding up well. After turning on my monitor it goes out, and back and again quickly a few times. But it stops after a few minutes."
1,"My headphones has a bad quality make and when I try to detach the wire, it broke off. When I called Logitech, they said it's not covered by their warranty, in their warranty policy, it said:<br /><br /> IN ADDITION, LOGITECH IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER, OR PARTNER, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION RECEIVED BY LOGITECH, ITS SUPPLIERS, OR OBTAINED OTHERWISE WILL CHANGE THIS DISCLAIMER.<br /><br />Amazon is actually letting the manufacturer post a false advestiment. I am really upset"
5,"The best sound of any earbuds I have ever tried. I listen to a wide variety of music, and I hear more detail with these earbuds."
3,It didn't really work like how I wanted it too.    For example when I plugged in two headphones they would receive only half the volume.
4,"the terk hdtno antenna has solved the problems of fluctuating reception. after a terk 5 indoor, and buying a monster antenna that came missing parts from  hh greg,and a couple of rabbit ears that did little of their claims,i am happy. this even fits the direct tv mast that was left when i quit the service and vowed to only view over the air tv, hdtv looks great and its free. free is good !happy in dayton ohio[[ASIN:B0009W9WHQ Terk HDtv Antenna Amplified]]"
1,These things are obsolete if they even work anymore.
5,The VXI B-250-XT is the best bluetooth headset out there.<br /><br />I have tried several that claimed to do well for sound quality and not having background noise but they did not perform half as well as the BlueParrott.<br /><br />With the new laws in affect that no commercial truck drivers can use a hand held phone this thing is the best!<br />I tested it at 75 mph with the windows down and the roar of the engine pulling a hill and the person i was talking to could not hear it.They said my voice was crystal clear.<br /><br />Buy it from Amazon and do not pay the 119.00 bucks the truck stops sell them for!<br /><br />Be sure to charge for 12 hours before the first time you use it.<br />It lasted me 2 days of use and was still going strong when i plugged the charger back in.
5,it looks very well made and looks good too sitting under the computer desk with its colorful backlit. another great product from monster as long you buy it at a discounted price
2,Didn't work as intended...not the fault of the vendor though....I tried using it on my 2008 VW Passat....the radio wouldn't read the signal through it.
1,"doesn't work, doesn't even light up the screen, and the seller doesn't respond."
5,This product is great and is what you would expect. I really don't know what else to say about it.
5,great part
5,I have mounted several LCD wall mounts but this is the best of the lot.  Highly recommended.
5,"ordered this cable with two day delivery and it came on time.<br />i used it with the lg pf-85u led projector and a pioneer receiver. movie night was great for the family, the picture was excellent and the surround sound from the receiver was awsome."
5,Works great!
1,"I could not get the monitor to recognize the input from the cable. I am not sure why and returned it and reverted back to the older connection. One speculation I had was that this might have been a uni-directional cable and I had ordered the wrong one, but I don't know. OTOH, it was a long time ago."
4,"After initially getting a reverberation from the unit while sitting on the TV cabinet, I mounted it above and behind the TV and it now works great. I believe it was the down-facing speaker on the underneath side of the unit that was causing this."
5,"For years I was interested in getting a multi-region player but some models were quite expensive and others I wasn't sure if they worked correctly or were very reliable. Well, after years of collecting region 2 dvds (they played fine on my pc) I decided to finally upgrade and get a player for multi-region dvd AND blu-ray. This player did the trick. I've had it for several months now and have only had a few minor issues. Now I can watch all that cool stuff from the UK in HD along with all my dvds, regardless of region. And the merchant I got it from (Global Electronics) was quick on delivery and quick on questions and issues via e-mail. Very tempted to get another, and when I do I'll go with Global."
5,works well!
1,Returned
5,Surprisingly good sound. Very easy to link to iPhone.
3,"These Ear Pads are just okay. The padding is just like the ones replaced. The only bad thing about these is that they keep coming off. They need to put elastic or gather the part that has to be put in the sides. My dad has had this headset for a couple years before having to replace Ear Pads, so instead of returning the Ear Pads, I used a hot glue gun and put a little bead of glue around the edge, by the time he needs new Ear Pads it will be time for him to get an upgraded headset."
5,I can't speak from personal experience since I purchased this for my 16 yo daughter.  But comments from her like this is the best thing since sliced bread and the fact that she always has it in her hands and is searching for new apps leads be to believe its an excellent product.
5,I love these earphone tips. they really fit in the ear well. I wear my iPod almost all day. they stay in place and don't cause ear problems.
4,Arrived as described. On first use it was good.
5,Quick shipping. A+
5,"This is great for me.  I have a regular Sony Dream Machine and I wanted one that would work with my Ipod so that I could fall asleep to my relaxation apps and audio books.  It works great.  I thought it was very easy to set up and it took less than 5 minutes out of the box!  The directions were clear and it was pretty intuitive.  I love that you can dim or turn off the LED completely.  The sound is just as good as my other Dream Machine and I would explain it as &#34;personal use&#34; speaker.  I wouldn't use it any louder than 16... it's not a boom box it's an alarm clock radio and as such it's great!  It met all my criteria: Ipod compatible, back-up battery, LED dimmer, Sleep timer, FM radio to wake-up to my favorite station, Antenna to ensure my favorite station comes in, and it is just the right size.  For an Ipod it doesn't come with the seat part so you do need to have that piece that comes with your Ipod to fit in the clock and hold the Ipod in place.  Mine was white and I think it looks cool to have the white piece on the black clock.  It does come with three various seats for different versions of the IPhone. Overall I am very pleased."
5,"i bought these as a replacement for my previous set of v-moda lps using their immortal life program.Their customer service is top notch,i always get a quick response whenever i contact v-moda with an inquiry on their products.The sound quality is very even and loud.I love these headphones,so much so that i bought a pair for my brother and my sister in law too."
5,Great item
5,I love these headphones. Unfortunately I threw them in the wash by accident so they no longer work. I would recommend them to anyone who loves a good bass.
1,It didn't work at all. I couldn't even turn it on and was so dissapointed that I sent it back.
5,A great flexible system for just plugging in a bunch of different sized power plugs.  has some surge protection just in case for what you don't ever want to replace.
5,perfect
5,"Very pleased with the purchase. I was very surprised with sound it puts out when my iPhone is playing from it. The price was great, has a nice look to it and it doesn't take up a lot of space. Great purchase.<br /><br />Updated: 3/15/2012.. Well after owning this for a month now I have experienced a major malfunction, my Iphone will no longer play on it. Don't know why but the music will not play through the speakers. So, I will be calling for either a refund or a new one."
5,"Received the power filter before requested promise date and I used the free shipping option. :) The unit is very well built with a heavy duty power cord and plug - nice that the plug is a right-angle plug so it fits snuggly against the wall outlet. The unit came with its own mounting bracket - though I did not use the hardware included - wanted to be sure it never came loose from the wall so used screws that were a little more substantial. The mount bracket slots are spaced nicely and accepted the heavier screw, (my choice) also included is a template to mark the location of the screw holes and a sketch of the unit to show the dimensions of the filter prior to mounting as to not contact the TV mount. Having the LED lights on the end plate of the filter is a great location making them easy to read with a glace behind the TV. All in all - very satisfied with the packaging, construction and ease of mounting and would definitely purchase another one of these for a second/third TV an or home theater device in another room."
1,They stopped working once they got past Amazon's date for returns. Never got these to successfully pair with my laptop or phone. POS Don't buy this crap.
1,"I bought 100 of these on sale, I thought Sony, should be good.  How wrong I was.  I've had a high fail rate, about 3 of every 5 disks. I've had no problem with the red hp or verbatim disks.  If I try something other than those 2 again then I'll buy the smallest quanity I can, see if they work first before buying 100. Not even good coasters :-("
3,"The cord itself is well built and delivers as a legit monster product. However...unless you have an old TV with one HDMi slot, this cord will block your other ports and forget about using it on the side HDMI, the angle of it makes it useless. You can put the right angle in the output of the digital device but you will then have to place your device on a book or something to lift it off the table to account for the length of the angle. This is with a 55 inch Vizio. On my 42 inch Sylvania LED, the HDMI ports are on the bottom of the TV so the right angle bumps into the front face plate and cannot be plugged in.<br /><br />It's a good idea to make sure the HDMI ports on the back of your TV are flush and not close together otherwise it will block the other ones. Also, the side HDMI is a no go as newer TV's are thinner than the inch and half angle length making it so you can't even plug it in. This will only work with a flush HDMI slot on the back of your TV. It was created to eliminate the wasted space from your cables jutting out like zombie arms. Good idea, but to be used for ideal situations as listed above."
1,"I HAVE AN RCA AMPLIFIED ANTENNA THAT RECEIVES 28 CHANNELS HERE IN NEW SYMRNA BEACH, FL.<br />THE TERK AMPLIFIED ANTENNA ONLY RECEIVED 9 CHANNELS!<br />IT HAS BEEN RETURNED FOR CREDIT!!!<br />CALLED THE COMPANY ON 12/4 AND OT A RUNAROUND ABOUT THEM BNG<br />SOOO BUSY THAT THEY HAD NOT BENABLE TO ADDRESS THE TURNS!<br />WAITING SOR A DIRECT CALL FROM THE COMPANY LOCATED IN Mo."
5,Bought these for a co-worker who dosen't own a PC and she loves them!! I tested them out to and they have great sound for the price. I am a sound tech and have the 200 dollar plus model for professionals when I am running events and I was very impressed with the quality of Sennheiser products. If you want an affordable pair of headphones for your portable audio or home these are it. Beats big chain store prices.
5,"For the size of this little switch its performance is amazing. Wonderful picture and sound provided with great convenience of automatic sensing of active input device. Manual selection and remote are a nice bonus if you have more than one connected input device on at the same time, but if you will only be using one at a time the automatic switching works wonderfully providing seamless operation."
5,This product is wonderful! Excellent reception and picture quality. I now get 39 channels for free!
4,"Used on my laptop screen.  Cleans well.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it was supposed to help keep the screen clean, but it actally seems to attract more dust..................however, maybe that's just because the screen is so much cleaner, and I'm actually noticing the dust.  :)"
5,"Great value for the money, I have seen other mounts like this for close to double the price.  It's well made and does exactly what it says it does."
5,Cable works exactly as it should. Great price. Great picture. Definitely beats paying retail price at Best Buy or anywhere like that.
5,All their products have worked great with not a single malfunction.  I love working with the 4-pin LED lighting products especially when they work right the first time.
5,Great product
4,"Purchased this remote after reading the reviews. Was a bit worried with some of the negative ones, but since it was compatible with the the dish network figured I would give it a try. When it got here looked for the code for the dish and  followed the directions which were easily understood. First code I entered was a hit and I could again changes the channels on the dish.   Then tried to look up the code for my TV. Not so lucky there, they did not have it. Tried using the 0 code that was suppose to work if your TV was not listed, but that did not work. So then tried the learning command. Again no luck, tried a few times, but could not get it to work. Figured since I really had only gotten it to replace my dish remote was not a big deal. Even though it would have been nice to only have to use one remote.  After reading the learn directions again realized I might have been doing it wrong. So today tried again to learn some of the TV remote commands. This time it was successful with one minor glitch. When I use the volume control it works backwards. When you turn it up it goes down and when you turn it down it goes up. Not a big deal since I can now control the dish and TV from the same remote. The off and on for the tv works fine. I did not program anything else yet because for now that is all I need, but it is nice to know that if I want to put more things on the new remote I can."
5,Bought item for my daughter to use with her Tab3 & she loves it!!!! It is adjustable so even I can wear it.... The colours and design are vibrant & its comfortablem... My only wish for future designs is that volume could be adjusted from head phone... I definitely reccommend this product.
4,"This speaker is loud enough, and very portable!  Two things that they should improve in this speaker:  1. Bass- The bass is a little weak.  2. The cable should go on the bottom of the speaker (like X-mini II).    I have both, X-mini II and ihome.  X-mini II has a very impressive bass, and the cable is built-in.  If you don't give attention to bass go with ihome, otherwise spend some more to buy X-mini II, it will worth the money."
5,I have no complaints and you will not find this price per foot at Radio Shack or Best Buy. It does what is supposed to and I did not notice anything wrong with the definition.
5,PERFECT
5,"I purchased this cable to connect a laptop audio-out to our sound system. The cable came well packaged and arrived ahead of schedule, which was helpful in itself. I am very pleased with this adapter cable, too. It is very well made with solid metal connectors and a high quality, very flexible cable. No plastic connectors or stiff cables you can so often get stuck with. It even came with two velcro wrapping straps where most companies would only include one. I suspect this company makes the rest of their products this good as well. Give them a try. I don't think you will be sorry."
5,Simple but nice docking station for 4S and lower. (Or whatever Iphones have the larger prong).  Light is not too bright and clock is small and perfect size.
5,"I like this, it has 2 speakers and they sound awesome. At low volume you get full sound as well and ive cranked it up it was loud and clear. Size of a beer can aounds like a car stereo! Getting my mom one asap"
5,"I bought a AVR-1611 a year ago and use it with Energy Take Five Classic speakers, a Samsung 3D BluRay player and a very good Panasonic 42\\"" 1080P Plasma TV.  What an awesome system.  My wife and I go upstairs once a week for our in-house \\""night at the movies\\"" to watch and listen to this system - we can actually hear the cars coming thru the walls and the gun casings rolling across the floors)!  This is my third Denon receiver and every one has been excellent - fantastic amps and relatively easy setup for a component with so many options!!!  I once had a Yamaha receiver and it excelled at providing lots of different spound effects (jazz club, outdoor ampitheater, etc., etc.) and I found that I simply preferred to close my eyes and imgaine the performers were right in front of my easy chair!  So give me great amps (plenty of power and very low THD) and plenty of control (which is exactly what the Denons do) and I'm perfectly content!  I'm now shopping for a second AVR-1611 before the new ones are gone (with the next model year already released)."
5,Would recommend this product!
4,I liked this product but wish I had ordered it in black
5,Great sounding headphoness
5,"These guys have great bass and nice clear sound for a very reasonable price. If you can find a real pair for under $30, don't hesitate to buy these."
5,does the job with my soundbar in my small living room
5,"My brother got these for me a few years ago, and I think they're perfect. <br /> <br />My dad saves old power adapters, so thankfully I was able to solder together my own for this set of speakers, and I use them all the time.  They are my standard laptop speakers, but they're great if you've got an mp3 player and want to take your music almost anywhere.  I've brought them on a cruise, camping, to the beach, and they were a big help when I was out tabling on the main plaza at my school.   <br /> <br />They do have a buit of white noise when on, but it doesn't bother me a bit, and I think they're perfect for what they are.  I will be buying another set of them as a backup or just for extras."
5,Awesome!
5,"This antenna is great.  Setup in the attic took about an hour, tied it into my existing cable line which feeds the house.  I'm only about 10 miles from the station, and have yet to see any distortion or pixelation after 3 months.  Can't say the same about the feed from TWC."
3,"I have but to use the adapter because I already bought another adapter from the maufacturer so, I dont know if it works. The only reason why I have not used it before is because I could not find how much amperage the other unit has."
4,"The sound is very good, with a lot of differentiation between instruments - I'm hearing things I never knew were in the song. Fit is good too. A great value!"
5,I needed batteries in a hurry for my APC UPS.  My rating reflects that they were received well before expected data and the simple installation returned my UPS to online condition.  The UPS indicates that they are performing well with  very good back up time.
4,"I bought this because I was having a problem with the HD signal on some existing wiring.  The coax was fairly old.  The signal was boosted fine and the problem with the HD signal went away.  However, another problem came up.  I use Verizon FiOS and the Version DVRs send signals back to the Verizon servers using the high end frequency ranges.  All of my DVRs had the similar problems - they were either &#34;unable to connect to the server&#34; or they were unable to see the content on the other boxes  After spending time on the phone with tech support - the result was &#34;check your wiring&#34;..  I replaced the static, unpowered, splitters with one that were designed for HD signals and reran a new RG6 cable to the box that the other boxes could not see.  The &#34;can't connect to server&#34; error went away, but all of the boxes were not able to see everyone else.  I then removed the 8-port device and rebooted every server and every box could see all of the others.<br /><br />I did return the box and received a refund.<br /><br />So, even though it did not work completly in my case, it is still a good product."
4,"The wall mount was meant for 36\\"" TV.   It was installed in a difficult location as it has to be articulated for viewing.    It went up the first time and was level.   We have had issues with out mounts holding their level."
2,"I'm really surprised. I wanted to like this but Apple was asleep at the wheel. Never thought I'd say that about them. I just started using it, so there are things I haven't experienced yet. I used to own a 5Gen iPod, 80 GB, which I loved. But it got stolen and this was a replacement. I'd now sacrifice the added capacity to get my old model back. FTR, I also own an iPad 2, another great Apple product. I have been considering buying a Macbook Pro and leaving the Windows universe. This product is so flawed I'm reconsidering...seriously.   Here are my first impressions...I'll start with the positives.   PROS  1. The face looks more elegant than my previous iPod and the unit is thinner (a constant aspiration of iterative Apple design).   2. Double the memory of my 5Gen, 80GB (though I still had room to spare on the 5Gen).   That's it for the PROS.   CONS  1. The HD makes noise when you use it. Other people comment on this, and it's true. My older iPod was silent. This one chirps/whirs every time I click the controls. It's not loud, but it gets really annoying.   2. MY BIGGEST GRIPE: The edges are SHARP! It's an Apple iPod for crying out loud. Apple is known for its elegant design and feel. What were they thinking? The seam between the metallic back and face is a sharp edge that goes all the way around the unit. And I've got big, tough man hands...Used tools all my life. This thing feels like a cheaply manufactured piece of Asian garbage. When I rub my fingernail against the edge, it planes off shavings...seriously! It really is sharp. If I don't return the unit I will run a file around it to soften the edges. Shouldn't have to.   3. The split screen may have seemed to a young, inexperienced designer like a cool idea to pack more info, but the truth is (as others have said here) it just mucks up what used to be a clean, usable interface. It is useful for things like Settings, where it give more detailed info, but for most of the use it just shows pieces of album covers -style over substance. The user should be able to modify its function in Settings. There has been a trend to add thumbnail pics to everything, including smartphone apps. Often, though this adds tiny visuals that add nothing but get in the way of great clean interfaces. There is a reason Craigslist still rocks with its seemingly stone age interface. IT WORKS! You get exactly what you need without superfluous visual muck that competes for your attention. I consider it a step backwards.    I have not yet tested it thoroughly to hear if, as other have mentioned, the sound quality has been degraded over previous models.   For me the CONS are significant. The Classic has been out for years now. Every change should be an improvement. I really wonder if they WANT people to run away from non-iPod \\""Touch\\"" models. If so, making people waste money on unpleasant designs like this is a pretty annoying way to do it. Good money for a device that feels like handling a steak knife by the blade.   Recommend evaluating a unit physically before buying online to see if you like it."
3,walls block reception pretty easily
5,"I have been buying these tapes for years because of their higher reliability compared to cheaper mini DV cassettes, such as some JVCs that I tried before. I do a lot of HDV recording, but the price of Sony \\""HDV cassettes\\"" is way too high to be efficient. My archive library consists of over 300 mini DV tapes because they hold so little footage, and I trust these Maxells to store my HD footage. They record for about 01:02:30, that being about 2.5 extra minutes you get out of them which I have used on occasion! They work well with my Sony HVR-M15AU mini DV/HDV deck and dropout rate is very low. I used these as a backup for a critical show production requiring pristine quality video where computers would otherwise fail. Because HDV is a digital format, the tape quality does NOT affect picture quality, but it DOES affect reliability (i.e dropouts and errors). If you need cheaper tape stock for HDV recording and playback, I highly recommend these as a cheaper alternative to the \\""HDV\\"" labeled cassettes.<br /><br />Say NO! to the HDSLR revolution!!!"
3,An USB cable had been damaged - connection/charge fails.I had to buy a new one that has been working well.
5,We love it. I'll buy more. Great sound. Better than other brands I have seen. Simple. Power efficient. Versatile little speaker.
4,"This is the second set of wireless headphones I've owned. First was JVC. Sound is good -- I use it exclusively with TV so as not to disturb sleeping family members, so not sure if it would be audiophile quality with a high quality source. Seems well constructed, very comfortable to wear for extended periods. Charging cradle is great. Just set it on rack and little worry about whether the contacts are lined up or properly positioned."
3,"These are soooo comfortable and don't hurt my ears like on-ear headphones. The only thing is, the sound quality doesn't seem that great. Also sometimes the sound in one side goes out and I have to twist the cord around where it's connected near the top. Usually that fixes it but it's annoying."
1,This bulb only lasted for about six months.
5,Very useful or two and three prong US plugs when traveling in Germany. You don't need more expensive kits; this does the job.
5,I used to use it so I know It good Product as quality sound and picture .I use it to burn some movie on youtube .
5,This is a great little device; after inserting it between my computer and the D/A converter I heard an immediate improvement. Well worth the small price paid.
4,"I bought these to use on my motorcycle and the noise isolating quality of the er6i's are great. They work great for riding, cutting grass, the gym, just about anything. I was disappointed in the sound quality. My pair of $20 skull candies sound better but come no where close on the noise isolation. All in all I am satisfied with these but think they are a little overpriced. If noise isolation is what you are after then give these a try."
5,Had problems with first pair received. Received a second pair that works well!
5,"For large TVs, this is the best mount for the money as it a full motion mount.  It is also relatively easy to install."
5,"Works great. If you already have a GPS unit attached to a regular mount, all you have to do is saw off the post directly above the bottom mount, and glue it into place here. There is no height difference because this piece is just a touch higher. No need to re-measure or change GPS settings in your software. Will definitely buy more of these as I build my fleet!"
5,Great to have when needed!
4,I especially like the pull cord release mechanism which makes for easy TV install and uninstall once the bracket is fastened to the wall.  The reason I didn't give it five stars was due to the lack of fine adjustment for leveling the TV after the bracket is mounted to the wall and because I thought the bracket held the TV away from the wall more than it should have - it wasn't as low profile as I would have liked.  I'm happy with the performance of the mount and its price.
5,"I have always connected my smart phone to my vehicles audio input jack for music and navigation. I've used several \\""headphone extensions\\"", auxiliary cables, and brand name \\""audio cables\\""....they all turned out to be losers, regardless of price...<br /><br />This cable works perfectly with it's right angled plugs. It's much harder to accidentally unplug the cable when it mounts more flushly. The audio quality its excellent! Much better than expected as the cable seemed to be thinner than previously purchased cables (which is generally a \\""trick of the trade\\""...add thicker insulation/shroud to give the appearance of a higher gauge/quality wire). I will also note that some 3.5mm \\""headphone\\"" plugs themselves do not \\""lock\\"" firmly when attached but these plugs seem to make FULL contact with the \\""female\\"" plug and lock firmly in place for less accidental disconnects exposing the poor guy at Starbucks to your horrible Ipod mix of 80's workout jams :) I'd recommend these highly!"
5,Slow ship but the comp wire was correct.I hooked it to my playstation2 works great!!! What a different picture with this cable love it!!!Much clearer pic and graphics!Old games seem new with this cable highly recommend it!!I play on a 32inch SHARP LCD HDTV!!!
5,Exellent! Thank you very much!
5,Awesome. Bass is great. Treble is good. Blue tooth connected no problem. The sound great. Best head phones I've bought.
5,"I can't even begin to tell you how great this charger is.  NLee the Engineer has by far the best reviews on this type of product, and everything that compares to it as well.  I would strongly encourage everyone to consider his reviews and a few others too, that put this charging system and it's other models by La Crosse, high on the &#34;must read&#34; list.  So much more than a quick charger, take the time to learn how to use this (which won't take much time at all) and you will love it!!!"
5,Bought the led lights and transformer recommended<br />But if you run a long (12 ft) that one did not work. Got to hot to touch<br />This one stays cool<br />Works fine
5,"Fits most types of audio needs. Very nice set of adapters. Good Quality. A must have, for audio on the go."
5,"I bought this unit for my Family Room because I wanted to have the following there: 1) Better sound from the front speakers, 2) Bluray player, 3) Working surround sound (had problems with some FOX programs), 4) Netflix streaming. 5) Ability to use HDMI to connect everything<br /><br />I had an older THX certified Onkyo receiver and a Panasonic DVD player connected before - neither of them had HDMI support. I had surround sound, but it was using the small cube speakers from Cambridge.<br /><br />I am very happy with this unit. The front speakers have three drivers each and the sound is a lot fuller than my previous setup. The stands are kind of big, so you need to allocate floor space for them. I don't see any way to use the front speakers without the stands. You can use your own speaker wire for all speakers - something that is very important for me and not seen in some of the cheaper units. Since the subwoofer amplifier is in the main unit, you can move the subwoofer to anywhere you can get the speaker wire. My previous subwoofer had a built-in amplifier and I had to keep it behind the TV and use shorter line level cables to the receiver. This new subwoofer was actually vibrating the surroundings back there so I had to move it to another corner of the room with more open space. Was pretty easy since I had a large spool of speaker wire. I did not use any of the wire that was included with the system. I used a much heavier gauge with no problem.<br /><br />You should buy an analog sound meter to calibrate the speakers. There is a setup menu on the GUI that lets you send white noise to all the speakers. I had to knock down the center speaker a bit and crank up the two surrounds to get everything equalized. You can find a few on Amazon, like this one: [[ASIN:B0000YHNKG Extech 407706 Analog Sound Level Meter]] - but they are also available at RadioShack. Set it at 70db, C weighting, slow response. Send the test signal out the left front speaker. Adjust the volume until the meter reads 0dB. Then you just cycle through all the other speakers and adjust them so that the meter also reads 0dB. It's pretty simple and the meter is worth the money. You cannot do this with your ear. I have had my meter for years.<br /><br />The Bluray performance is great. The movies look sharp and crisp on my Sony SXRD projection TV in 1080p/60Hz. The Netflix streaming was also flawless. I didn't order anything from CinemaNow, but the interface seemed to work quickly - just like the entire GUI. Before this unit, I had never heard of Pandora Radio. It's very cool and super easy to use with this system. The unit must enable some Dolby matrix setting because Pandora radio comes out from the surrounds too. YouTube was also easy to use, but I think that prefer the Apple TV interface for this. I did not try Audio CDs or the USB port yet. Don't really need those with the Apple TV pulling all those stuff from my iMac automatically. The iPod dock seems pretty convenient, but again I don't need that since I have an Apple TV. I did try plugging in my iPod touch (first generation) into the dock and it couldn't seem to access it. I have some newer iPods that I can try - the manual shows a very complete GUI interface for the iPod integration so it should be a nice feature for those without an Apple TV. Now that I think about it- if I had bought this device first, I may have never purchased an Apple TV.<br /><br />The only thing that I am having trouble with is the integration with my Harmony One remote. It seems that LG does not supply discrete remote codes for source inputs. The 'InputNext' button downloaded to the Harmony was also not working. I had to re-learn that function and program it to the 'Enter' key for each Activity. The Harmony could not seem to switch between activities using this button, so I will just do it manually. I couldn't seem to find a way to have the LG skip over my unused inputs - like FM, AM, Coaxial, Optical. I am hoping for a firmware updatethat would do this because it would speed up the input switching task. I suppose they could also add these discrete codes using a firmware update. That would be great, but I'm not sure how long it would take Logitech to get the codes into their database.<br /><br />This system really is a great buy. I have not found another device close to this price that included HDMI inputs and full range front speakers. My room is about 15 x 20 and the sound levels are fine. I can recommend this device for small to large rooms without hesitation. I have a front projector in my basement paired with much larger in wall and a full 7.1 speaker system setup. This LG is a much easier setup that has great performance. Unless you are willing to buy and build a real home theater setup, you should be very happy with this unit.<br /><br />UPDATE 12-31-09: The iPod dock does work. Finally realized that I needed to use the iPod button on the original remote to access it. The InputNext button on my Harmony One would not cycle to the iPod. Also, the USB interface did play music and photos from a USB drive fine, but as was mentioned by others will not play videos.ed up the input switching task.

5,"I really rely on user reviews when buying unfamiliar technology, so when I was tempted to by a cheap IR wireless headset, I started reading reviews.  I quickly decided to go with RF instead of IR because I wanted to walk all over the house, outside, etc.<br /><br />But there were tons of choices.  The reviews kept taking me back to the Sennheiser RS-120, so I bought one.  They are great!<br /><br />They are comfortable to wear, and the sound quality is great. I can walk anywhere in the house or in my backyard or front yard, and there's no problem with reception.<br /><br />What I really love is the way they stay charged.  The headphones are equiped with rechargeable batteries, and when you drop the headset back in it's cradle, it charges automatically.  Two hidden metal contact points in the headband automatically make contact with the metal points on the charger, so you don't have to plug them in.  They are always ready.<br /><br />Now my wife wants her own set."
5,"We recently converted from a rear projection TV to a wall mount plasma and we bought these speakers to replace our floor standing units.  While I did not expect these speakers to do as well as my high end towers, I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality.  While they don't sound as good as my old Image speakers, they are a close second and are a fraction of the cost.  The sound quality is improved by adding fiberglass insulation behind the speaker, but you may have to drive them a bit harder to get the same volume.  I also had some issues with the clips not spinning out, but realized this was because I test fit the speakers a couple of times (first to test the fit, secondly to add insulation).  I found that the problem is that the plastic clips get lose when you run the screw through them a couple of times.  A bit of Locktite (nail polish would also work) will hold the clip to the screw allowing it to spin into position."
5,"I did a bunch of research on ipod speakers and found some that were pretty loud. But why do they have to be so expensive? The ipod is the technology and what we are looking for is just speakers. (tiny ones). I needed speakers for the beach, not for my house or to entertain many people. Just my wife and I at the beach. For me,paying $184 for tiny speakers for the beach would be rediculous. But this Logitch mm22 is perfect for me. I was actually impressed by the sound. Like I said it is for the beach and sits on the blanket with us. Someone wrote that the cradle kept falling. Well don't use it! Just lay the Ipod next to it. You don't even have to fold the speakers up. Just leave them down. If you buy ipod speakers for looks or major entertaining, you're a fool. Buy some rechargable batteries and you are good to go. Enjoy"
5,Just would like to say I am very impressed with the fast delivery and more impressed with the quility of the cable even though it's made in China. Whats not these day's!
5,"I do a lot of instrumental music recording and performing, and I use these Sony rechargeables EXCLUSIVELY in my gear, the most power-hungry of which are my [[ASIN:B000VBH2IG Zoom H2 Handy Portable Stereo Recorder]] and my [[ASIN:B0015YG34M GigLight Compact LED Music Stand Light]].  I also use them in my [[ASIN:B000V1VG2E Canon PowerShot A720IS 8MP Digital Camera with 6x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom]] when going \\""optical\\"" rather than \\""audible.\\""<br /><br />I can EASILY record two hours of music on my H2 with two of these batteries at 44.1kHz, 16-bit.  I have never even come close to their running out early, and I've never had the device quit because of a lack of power.  And I have recharged these MANY times for MANY gigs.<br /><br />Loading my GigLight with these, I have found I can run it OVERNIGHT -- even 24 hours! -- and not drain them completely.<br /><br />Plus, the batteries last between 200-400 pictures in my Canon, depending on whether I'm using a lot of flash and whether or not I leave the AF on \\""continuous.\\""  I'm never short of power.  It's amazing.<br /><br />Charge time is very reasonable, and when I use the H2, which uses only 2 batteries, I have a spare pair at the ready if I need them.<br /><br />These leave Alkis in the dust!  HIGHLY recommended -- and that's high praise because I'm generally NOT a Sony fan.  But I am a fan of these!"
5,"I have tried many in ear headphones over the years, with varying success. Most of them have ended up breaking within a few months. Not these. Aside from being durable, they sound fantastic.  The bass response is very good, better than any other in ear headphones I have used. Excellent clear treble as well, I have never heard any distortion out of these headphones, and they can get surprisingly loud. Forget the pricier in ear phones, and buy these!"
5,Only lightscribe CDs I use. Always a good buy and always delivered intact.
5,is what it is a cheap wall mount 40 inch samsung was on the wall in less than 10 min reeeeal close to wall
5,"I've been very happy with Eneloop rechargeables for a number of years now. My stocks got depleted when I moved and since the number of battery-operated devices I had was increasing, I went ahead and got the full set. Charger, batteries, &#34;C&#34; and &#34;D&#34; cases. They charge quickly, they hold a charge well, and they're good quality batteries even after Sanyo sold them to Panasonic."
5,"I ran this from my receiver to a tower speaker, and the sound is great. I can't detect any signal loss or distortion due to the length of the cable. It reminds me a lot of the horrible overpriced Monster cables."
5,"A simple to use device that was ready to go out of the box.  My 14 year old had it clipped to his bag as he road his bike to practice about 10 minutes after opening the box.  The sound is clear and reacted as expected to changes to the equalizer setting on the iPhone 6, which it is linked.  It is also linked to an iTouch, 3rd generation.  No issues at all.  The first full charge lasted about 9 hours of play time.  Great value!"
5,I bought two pair for both my son's because we travel a lot and they can use them on there DS and also the screens that are in the car. Amazing quality. They are super clear and they adjust to both there heads perfectly. Would def recommend!
1,"Awful sound quality, strange static and ringing noises regardless of what I plugged into it. Purchased two and both were malfunctioning. Didn't feel like it was worth the time to get my money back."
5,it worked like a charm on my Surface Pro Tablet. I have no complaints this is great for on the go plugging into a projector or into a nice big monitor at the office so I can have two screens!
4,"I'm happy with the performance and it has already protected my Apple Mac Mini and LCD TV set up during a storm and during power outages.  My only beef is the display, which shows interesting information is impossible to read, except from directly in front of it.  Mine is on the shelf in the cabinet below the TV, flat on its back.  The only way to view the display is to pull it out with all the cords attached.    Other than that, it works great."
2,"These sound like toy headphones, the cord is cheap, they are not particularly comfortable... no reason to buy these"
4,"Very compact design and you will need to read the instructions carefully to save stations because its not all that intuitive. Having said that, the radio delivers what it promises. HD FM radio.  HD radio is similar to HD TV- the signal is very strong or gone and if you scan stations in one location, they may not be available in another.    I rode the train with this radio and found it satisfactory in holding stations (with occasional loss of signal for a moment or two)and clear sound delivered through small earbuds.    There is no AM frequency, and the only way to charge the battery is by connecting to a PC unless you buy additional  accessories."
1,"Product is too heavy to place on shirt, Magnet is hard to remove and the sound quality is really bad!"
4,This didn't work to make my video camera start working again but I think there is something more seriously wrong with it and I need to take it in for repair.
1,"My mother-in-law bought this for my 5-year-old son for Christmas.  It's a nice looking clock and sounds decent.  However, it is virtually unusable.  It has, I think, 7 cones on it for control buttons.  However, you have to use exactly two of them to set the time, the alarm time, the alarm on/off and the date.  I'm an engineer and it takes me time to figure out how to do it.  There's no way my 5-year-old can.  And for him, he'll just hit the cones and change something and then you have to reset everything.    Also, with the radio, it's not AM, only FM, despite the description.  And there are no presets or even an indicator of what channel you're on.  All you have is a Scan button.  Hope you don't miss the channel you were looking for.    This is just a very poorly designed clock.  It looks nice, but I can't imagine they let anyone try to use it before they put it in mass production."
5,i had a sony before this it worked great. i had to upgrade though when we bought a 3d tv. i was disapointed the remote would not work with other products that were not sony.
5,It works with no problems.
1,This product arrived quickly to my residence. It was not the correct piece of equipment. It matched the specs for my unit but did not have the corect end piece.  I had to order another product.
3,"The audio quality of the Phiaton PS 20 NC is above average: full bass, clear midrange and slightly rolled-off treble.  The overall sound is \\""warm\\"".  Using an equalizer to boost treble can restore some of the high frequencies.  The large audio drivers may be uncomfortable for people with smaller ears.<br /><br />I used a set of Comply foam tips to improve ear comfort for longer listening sessions.  The Phiaton's active noise reduction does not function effectively.  Jet and wind noise are very audible with or without the noise reduction engaged.  Compared to the Audio Technica  ATH-ANC23 earphones I had previously, the Phiaton PS 20 NC provide negligible ambient noise reduction on a jet airliner (McDonnell-Douglas DC9-50).  I tried back-to-back comparisons in-flight with a set of Ultimate Ears UE700 passive earphones with Comply foam tips, and the UE700 earphones allowed significantly less noise leakage than the Phiatons.  In a relatively quiet office environment, the Phiaton's provide a subtle reduction in background noise, but it is not worth paying a premium for this minor improvement."
5,These headphones are such a good price.  They are not the highest quality but for the price they are more than worth it.  If you like to have audio at a certain level (whether lower or higher than the other person you are watching tv with) then this product is worth your investment.
4,"This new line of flash-based, coin-like (but they are thick coins, esp. in the waist!) MP3/ATRACT players from Sony are the latest models of their Psyc line of digital music players.  The new-age styling of these MP3 players does psyc you out. Which is not a bad thing, as they are more euro-cool than the rather bland and boring iPod and the downright butt-ugly iRiver. The more I look at the Psyc, the more I like its looks.<br /><br />The new silver Psyc MP3 player features 1GB of flash memory, which is great for those of you jogger jocks out there. You can shake this thing violently and it won't skip a beat, unlike those hard drive-based players. Before you insert an AAA battery, the Psyc weighs in at an amazingly light 0.9 oz. -- that's right, folks, it's less than an ounce! With the AAA battery, my guess is it's about 2 oz. It's very small although, relatively speaking, it looks a little thick -- esp. in the middle area where the single AAA battery resides. (About 0.75 in. at its thickest part.)<br /><br />What, you ask, it uses an AAA battery? Yes my friend, and this one AAA alkaline battery can power the player up to 70 hours! That's almost three full days of continuous playing. The phrase \\""up to\\"" here means that in order to get all 70 hours of playing, you must 1) play ATRAC3Plus songs encoded at 48kbps and 2) do not press buttons or do random play (i.e., just leave the player playing sequentially). In the real life we like to skip a song, fast forward, random play (a.k.a. shuffle play), turn it on and off and on and off, and most importantly, we play MP3 songs. All these operations reduce the battery life. Given my experience with previous Sony MP3 players, my estimate is one good AAA battery should last you 40 hours or more. (With my beloved Sony NW-HD3, I routinely get the advertised battery life of 30 hours even when playing MP3 files.)<br /><br />Of course, the use of AAA means you get an abundant and ready supply of cheap power source, and you can trek in the Amazon for weeks on end without having to worry about finding an AC outlet.<br /><br />The Psyc also comes in three other colors (green and blue for the 512MB version, and orange for the 256MB version).  It has a nice, sharp backlit LCD screen, so you always know what you are playing as opposed to having to guess as on some other certain MP3 player. It plays MP3 as well as Sony's ATRAC songs. If you are an ATRAC fan you'll like the sound quality of this little player; it's at least as good as Sony's MD players. For MP3's, the sound quality is a bit \\""muffled\\"" compared to my NW-HD3 20GB player, but still quite good if you pair it with a good pair of headphones (i.e., ditch the stock earphones).<br /><br />Sony still has a long, long way to go in the user interface department, as this has always been its weakness, whether it's digital music or digital video or anything else. The Psyc is not hard to use; its basic functions are no-brainers. But, for anything beyond play/pause/skip, its interface, whether on the unit itself or on the PC transfer side, is still not polished and was clearly designed for a Japanese audience -- Japanese consumers reportedly love to play with complicated gadgets; no surprise given how elaborate sushi-making and origami are. We American consumers like things that are elegant and simple, and Sony has a lot of room for improvement in this regard.<br /><br />In short, I don't think you'll be disappointed in the new Psyc flash-based MP3 players. They are stylish and lightweight and lasts forever on cheap AAA batteries. They have good sound quality and are priced right. Just be prepared to spend some time with the manual and experimenting a little with transfering music. If you are stuck, you are welcome to e-mail me at gadgester @t hotmail with your questions.<br /><br />Recommended.n trek in the Amazon for weeks on end without having to worry about finding an AC outlet.  <br /> <br />The Psyc also comes in three other colors (green and blue for the 512MB version, and orange for the 256MB version).

5,Purchased this cable to connect my PS3 to my receiver. Build quality is excellent. No problems at all. I would recommend this product to anybody needing a quality HDMI cable at a reasonable price. I would not hesitate to purchase other AmazonBasics products in the future.
5,"The wife bought one of these over a year ago and absolutely loves it!  She also has the mouse pad.  Yes, they do stain after awhile, but, they sure help her when using the computer all day.  I give this five stars!!"
2,"I purchased these for my husband who wanted some high end head phones.  He tried to like them but they just did not work.  I used them to see what was wrong and thought they were more complicated than necessary.  For one they had to be charged prior to use.  I am not sure why as they could be used without charging but reportedly you get a better sound with charging, I could not tell the difference.  The control box attached is big and bulky and awkward if you are trying to listen to something on go you need to have a pocket to put this in and lastly the earpieces just did not fit snugly or stay in my ears despite changing the size of the tips.  I was very disappointed especially at this price point."
5,This is the most simple and most handy little do-dad i have ever seen! I love it! It makes is very easy to carry your headphones with you any where you go without having to untangle them when you get there. I highly recommend this little gem!
1,"....& need to fix: Video quality. It's poor, static-prone & easily bumped by external factors such as mobile phones, computers etc.<br /><br />The biggest problem i had with it tho' is the internal battery. Although rechargable, the charge lasts for less than two hours (not 2.2 as mentioned)---far shorter than most of the activities it's being used for.<br /><br />Worse yet, the receiver only has a composite video output with stereo RCA audio jacks. Most TV's & especially monitors these days have HDMI as the standard. And as there are no adapters, you're going to have to hunt for an old fashioned TV to make this product work...."
5,"Purchased this to expand the number of optical inputs for a new sound bar and it works perfectly. Quick switching, low profile and makes my soundbar purchase that much sweeter. I didn't even know this type of product existed until I found it on Amazon. Been using it for 2 weeks and no problems"
4,"These lasted me awhile, maybe 6-8 months, with constant use (I like to listen to music before i go to sleep). I don't think I will be buying them again though, because the zipper loses its coolness after a couple weeks, and became somewhat a nuisance due to 2 thing:<br />The zipper adds some weight to the cord, and the zipper itself just feels weird."
5,"I never knew earbuds could sound this good!  The difference in quality is stunning.  Both with and without the noise cancelling I am hearing parts of my music that I hadn't heard on my Galaxy 3S before using these earbuds.  I had just assumed it was the limitation of the phone, but listening to orchestral or vocals with these earbuds revealed that there is nothing wrong with the signal.  This sound rivals my full sized Infinity speakers.<br /><br />The noise cancelling is very effective.  Having a &#34;kill&#34; button in the lanyard is a nice feature to have so that I can converse with a coworker or child without fumbling with my phone."
4,"I bought this for my wife as a gift.  It was easy to install and works flawlessly.  She is well pleased with it so that pleases me greatly.  I do think it was a little pricey but certainly within range.  Thus, I have given it an overall good rating."
5,Just what I needed it work perfect so far if it keeps working this way for a couple of years you got my business thanks
5,Love these headphones. They stay in no matter what.
5,This is great if you still have a TV or any other equipment that uses DVI.  Great picture quality and great for the price.
5,"My daughters, ages 13 and 8, both bought one of these with their holiday money. What a great choice! It came ready to go straight from the box. Both Sony's were fully charged and started right up, navigating was simple and syncing with our computer was a snap. Even our 8 year old opened it right up and moments later had videos uploaded and was happily listening to her favorite songs. The video quality is absolutely amazing. The screen isn't overly large but the image is crystal clear. Sure, they both love the ipod touches and admittedly, this lil gadget is only for music/book listening and video watching-not playing games or communicating electronically--but for the price and given their primary desire was to listen to music and watch some videos, this was a perfect choice and is still compact enough to easily carry around or even run with. A+ My only regret is not yet upgrading my own Philips GoGear"
4,"The sansa Fuze 8Gb is a good product for a good price.    the good :  + Compared to the ipod nano : price and radio + memory is good.  + can be seen like a external hard disk    the bad :   - the memory card extension is seen completly separated (so you can not manage all the library at the same time but split in 2)  - with a lot of title or different album, the navigation can be long (not fast speed, of shortcut ...)   - amazon send me the product in 15 days (standard shipping)"
4,"After my creative earphone was totaled by my 18 month old daughter, I have been looking for a replacement. With the positive reviews on Amazon, I decided to give this one try. Well, this earphones are just great! I prefer the traditional style with bigger drivers to the modern earplug style with tiny drivers. And this does have big drivers producing warm and smooth sound. I gave 4 star as the high frequency feels not crispy enough for me. However, this is very solid everyday earphone that you can get without breaking your piggy bank."
5,Easy to install. Strong connection. Small profile minimizes cable clutter behind an amp.
5,"One word, awesome. If it was not for a small scuff, I would have thought it was new! The interior was very clean, no dust whatsoever. The tape head, capstan, pinch rollers all did not require any cleaning from me. All I did was insert a cassette, plug it to my speakers and listen to music so clear I almost cried. Just kidding. The radio is flawless too. The only thing missing is Dolby NR capability but at $30, who's complaining. Perfect for those who want a good reliable cassette walkman without shelling a ton for those on ebay with absurd prices."
5,Great product... Even better price! Would recommend to anyone and everyone! All I has to do was put the batteries in and it worked!
4,"I like the player, but the volume resets each time to a very loud setting.  I have to turn the volume down BEFORE I put my headphones on."
1,"Mine does an automatic reboot on a regular basis while trying to listen to music.  I don't think I have ever had it play for more that 30 minutes.  I notified Rio of this, they assigned a \\""case number\\"" and made a suggestion for a solution.  By the time I tried the \\""solution\\"" and found that it did nothing it was beyond the warranty period.  I am now trying to negotiate having it covered under warranty, although I doubt that I will have much luck. <br /> <br />Don't buy this if you want a reliable product and don't want to throw your money away."
5,Bought 2 of these cables for a setup of Sony LED HDTV and Pioneer Elite VSX-53 AV Network Receiver. These work great and saved me a lot of money than buying overpriced cables. Definitely recommended!
2,most of my songs don't download on it and I can't even get it to play all the ones that do  every time I turn it on it starts with the same song and plays in the same order can't seem to change it
5,"I bought these headphones to sacrifice their drivers for a sound isolating headphone mod, and thought that I'd give these a try.<br />At $14, these are ridiculously good for the money.  They aren't Audio Technica M50s.  However at 10% of the price, they don't have to be.<br /><br />First, the weaknesses:<br />1. Look and feel cheap (they are cheap!)<br />2. No isolation (they're open headphones, duh!)<br />3. Not the richest, most airy, most resolving, or warmest headphones.<br />4. Cheap headband.  Pinches the ears after 10 minutes of wear.<br /><br />Strengths:<br />1. Very coherent.  While the highs aren't the highest and the bass isn't the strongest, overall the package works very well.  There's no overemphasis on any particular spectrum.  (Eg. Grado trebles, Beats bass).<br />2. Nicely textured.  Voices are nice and lively, textured.<br />3. Really cheap!  Most headphones in this class are around 4x-7x more (Sennheiser PX100, Grado 60i).<br />4. Includes a gold plated 1/4 jack converter.<br />5. Cables are not microphonic."
5,"It's 14 Ga wire, not much to say except it conducts electricity as expected.  And that's why I bought it."
3,"USB ports failed upon receipt, not sure if I should give it a second try.<br />If you are lucky to get a good one, it should be an ideal solution for someone like me who owns iPad and another Samsung tablet."
5,"What can you say about an HDMI cable?  It carries signal from one point to another, but this cable made me say &#34;wow&#34; to myself when I took it out of the box.  I was expecting a normal plastic-coated cable, but instead received a very nice flexible braided cable. It has a very nice tactile feel to it as a result, and looks great.<br /><br />I bought this cable mainly because of price, but got a cable far better than expected.  Very happy with BlueRigger, and I will definitely look for this brand again.  The seller also had very fast shipping."
1,This is my 2d or 3rd replacement lamp.  None of them work for more then 2-3 months.  Time to ditch the TV and upgrade I suppose.
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS!  UNLESS YOU BUY \\""ADD-ON\\"" SOFTWARE FROM ARCHOS YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY ANY VIDEO CONTENT IN AC3 FORMAT, WHICH IS THE AUDIO FORMAT MOST USED ONLINE!!!!!!!!"
2,I bought this for an upcoming trip to hold DVDs. I will be surprised if it holds up! It is very cheap plastic and will be easily crushed. I hope the DVDs survive!
5,"Very good product, my friend and I are very like."
4,"I originally purchased this item about 2 years ago and it has worked great for me since. I recently purchased a second one for a backup. I use it when sleeping at night to mask unwanted noises. The speakers are not too large for my ears - they fit fine as long as I use a soft pillow. I can imagine that using a harder pillow might be troublesome. The quality of the speakers are as I would expect and are very acceptable. The cord provided is not quite long enough for me to place my smart phone (which I use as the noise source) on my nightstand so I am using an extension cord. The only problem with the second purchase is that the headband seems smaller than the original and is very tight on my head.  It seems that the product is now being promoted as a sports headband and not for use while sleeping so maybe a tighter fitting headband is more appropriate?  Maybe it will stretch after some use, but it's definitely smaller than the original band I purchased.  If it weren not for the smaller headband I would have given the product 5 stars."
5,Easy to see time and date.
5,"Muy buen producto y entrega a tiempo , lo recomiendo , calidad y servicio , very good, excelente . ."
2,"1- Pig tail antenna wire is 30\\"" long and has to be plugged into headphone jack to have FM or TV reception though speaker.  No reception except AM without wire.  How would like a 30\\"" wire sticking out of your cell phone or PDA wifi?  Looks bad. <br />2- Bottom of radio case is not perfectly flat so it just barely stands up with speaker facing you.  Sangeon could have made a more flat bottom to case. <br />3- There are two timers.  A short count down and an alarm at some predetermined time.  Neither alarm will either shut off sound from radio or turn sound on at a set time.  So it can't be used as an radio on alarm travel or fall asleep to music.  I don't understand below comment about person falling asleep to radio and having it shut off. <br />4- If Amazon allows me to return it I will."
4,Nice charger handles AAA & AA batts. Included batts seem to have good capacity. Would be nice to have some AA batts included as well.
5,Love it! No more cable bill!!!!
5,"Great sound for such a little speaker.  It just plugs into the MP3, DVD or ipod that my son is always using and it keeps him from carring around a large speaker that always needs batteries."
4,Good cables to connect my system.
5,"I have purchased many Twisted Veins cables for use in auditoriums and have never been disappointed by the quality or the price.<br /><br />Pros: Quality, Extra goodies (Velcro Straps and Adapter), Price<br />Cons: Can't think of a single one!"
3,"Using this as I type. From my brief experience thus far, I would say I am satisfied. Love the cup action, noise cancellation with this bugger is stellar. Quiet handy in tuning out the wife and the noise from the tele. I like the fact that I can adjust the volume on each ear individually. I have not tried the stereo/mono function yet. Three stars because I just got it. Will edit review later."
5,A-1
5,"Not much to say about a cable.  It was inexpensive, works great and was delivered fast.  Can't imagine why anyone would pay more for this type of cable.  Well made."
3,"Honest Review: This product is not perfect, but I couldn't swim without it. I was on swim team all throughout middle school and high school but stopped after graduation. I loved swimming but the process of getting in and out of the pool was a pain and you can't even listen to music. I recently started lap swimming again as my primary exercise. I heard about these waterproof headphones from a friend and I was pumped to try them. I read the reviews, I knew what I was getting into with all the complaints. My main issue is that water still gets in through the sealed ear buds even though I sized them correctly. I usually lose sound in one ear after 15 minutes of swimming. When they dry the sound does goes back to normal in both ear buds. I cannot do flip turns or backstroke without them falling out. I use them for my warm up, cool down and light-moderate freestyle. They do have a more cons than pros but I am so happy that I can listen to music while swimming that I will take it."
2,"This is a sleek-looking, overpriced and poorly engineered MP3 player. I bought it because I really liked my Sansa e200, but wanted more than the 4G of storage I had (2G of built-in memory, plus a 2G micro SD expansion card). I should have gotten an 8G e200 instead of the \\""View 16\\"".    The worst disappointment about this device is the short battery life. The manufacturer's claim of 32 hours of continuous music play time is sheer fantasy. I have never been able to get it to play more than 5-6 hours of MP3 without needing a charge. Moreover, charging is very slow. I had it plugged into the USB port of my PC at work for about 4 hours this morning (it had been nearly dead at the end of the day yesterday). I got maybe 2-3 hours of play, then it shut down and gave me a red battery icon when I tried to start it.     The controls are also considerably inferior to the Sansa e200. The e200 has buttons around the blue volume dial that do what you would expect them to do--like traverse a menu vertically or horizontally. The View has a weird rubber-like washer that you're supposed to turn in order to navigate the menu or change the volume. It gives no tactile feedback whatever. I had to draw a mark on the rubber \\""washer\\"" to determine whether it was actually turning or not (yes, it does turn, but the effects appear to be completely random).     There are other bugs as well. For example, the display will often lag behind considerably; it will indicate that it is playing a song other than the one it is really playing...then suddenly it will update.     I'm giving it two stars because it DOES play MP3s. For a short time.   ------------------------  Update, 4 Sept 08    I still have this player, and am using it regularly at work to drown out the noise. (Yeah, and the voices...) Obviously, I'm not so dissatisfied that I returned this player. However, I still wish I'd bought the tried and true Sansa e-series instead.     The mechanical design of the View is actually pretty good--thoughI still hate the rubber washer that you're supposed to turn to choose menu options. The problem was and remains the firmware. I've updated to the latest version (the one released in June 08), and I think play time has improved by about 25%. It's still far short of the promised 35 hours, but it will do for my purposes.     However, the player continues to emit novel mutant behaviors. For example, the songs seem to multiply like bunnies. I'll select an artist or an album, and there will be about 8 to 10 entries for each of the songs that should be in the list. I'm sure the content hasn't actually been duplicated--I had about 20G of MP3s on there to begin with (have the 16G model with an 8G Micro SD card)--I think it's a database corruption issue. There's just numerous pointers to the same song. I have no idea how this happened--I've just been playing the music, and haven't downloaded new content via my PC. This is a major hassle, as I have to manually fast forward to the next song by skipping over the spurious entries. Putting the Sansa on random play means hearing the same songs over and over again, as it keeps finding the duplicate entries. Bah."
5,"What can you say? It's cheap, 10 feet long, and it works well. It's well made, and doesn't feel like the cheapest HDMI cable on Amazon."
5,did the job
5,They work great! Held firm even through the rain!
5,"Loud, sounds nice and was easy to connect to my wireless network. For the price it can't be beat. Glad I bought it The people dissing this speaker must be incompetent or clueless. It works great. Connection is easy, reconnection to a different wifi network is easy. Don't be fooled. It looks great, sounds great and is great. I love mine"
5,These are great! Just like the reviews said they would be! Even my 13 year old daughter noticed the great sound quality as quickly as the first day she used them! :)
1,"This item I purchased did not work, I had to buy another one from Frys much higher price but it worked."
5,"I've been paying over $20 a month for basic cable and, by basic, I mean about 10 broadcast channels. I finally bought my first digital TV (great deal on the LG 32LK330 here at Amazon) and wanted to change that. I didn't have high hopes -- the skyscrapers in Manhattan are notorious for making reception akin to living at the bottom of a canyon and, while I live fairly near the Empire State Building, my apartment faces away from it.<br /><br />My TV is on the wall furthest from the windows but I didn't want to invest in an extension cable until I knew if this antenna would work at all. I screwed it in, ran a scan and had 52 channels with PERFECT reception. (TVGuide says there are 56 digital channels in my area but I don't think I'm going to bother with an extension to try to get the other 4.)<br /><br />The Mohu Leaf is giving me 5 times as many channels and will pay for itself it 6 weeks. I'm only sorry I can't give it more than 5 stars."
5,I ordered replacement pads from Bose and returned them because they wouldn't snap into place. They aren't as soft as the originals but I like them.
1,"I suspect the manufacturer knows he is making a piece of junk but the very low price will entice buyers. I have many MP3 CDs, mostly books but also music. You can get 10 hours on one CD. But that system is dying and the good manufacturers have stopped producing MP3 CD players. My Supersonic never worked with an a/c adapter, and you had to bang it and repeatedly press the buttons to get it working. After I played a few disks it just died and nothing could get it to work. Luckily more good old MP# CD players have recently appeared on the market and I ordered a Panasonic. If you need one stick to Sony or Panasonic. Also, can anyone explain to me why a seller is selling a new  12-year-old Panasonic at an insane price? I mean who is dumb enough to buy it when good used ones are selling 10 times cheaper."
5,"I don't really know what else to write here. If I just write that it is an excellent product, then readers will probably vote my review as unhelpful, as they would expect me to describe the reasons why I rate this product so. Well, for that they should just read the description given here on the product's Amazon.com web page; it is accurate. The iSkin I bought for my 80 GB iPod is of excellent quality and finish, and serves its purpose just as is claimed for it. In addition, I would also commend the company covercase.com which supplied it to me at Amazon's behest. The service was quick and packing good. I am surprised to see a reviewer's negative comments below concerning covercase.com, although the iSkin.com website was not as responsive concerning some queries regarding problems I had when fitting the plastic shield to the silicone case's guide lips. But they were simple enough for me to figure out myself after I had studied it more carefully."
5,"Well received,packaging in good condition.<br />Adequate sound produce for room size.Clear sound.<br />Overall happy with this product.Very good buy for this price.<br />Thanks."
5,"These headphones provide great sound for the price, plus they're foldable, light, and pretty comfy. But the real reason the PortaPros get five stars is this: Koss stands behind their products. When a piece of plastic broke off my headphones (my own fault, really) I looked up my warranty and realized that I could get my headphones fixed for free. I was going to just buy the plastic piece and replace it myself, but Koss decided to send me a brand new pair in exchange for my old paid, plus pay for my return shipping. On top of that, Koss sent me the new version of the PortaPros.<br /><br />Whenever anyone asks me what type of headphones to get, I always recommend Koss. Whether you want a cheap good pair, like these PortaPros, or a studio set, you can't beat Koss's customer service."
5,The best receiver for the money great sound great picture easy to use the second zone works great and with my mts speakers it's loud and clear. Need for Speed hot pursuit you can hear the gravel under the tires of a car next to you
1,Tge battery kept giving out and now i have to buy a new charger because when I would charge the battery it wouldn't charge so my charger burned out
5,"We'd love to have a full sound system to enjoy music outside in our entire 1/2 acre backyard while the weather is nice, but that requires a huge investment in multiple speakers and receiver, plus an electrician to install it.  Now we have found this mini-alternative to work very well for a large patio, a section of the yard.  The battery life is as it says, about 3 hours. The range of the remote is a little limiting, though, perhaps 25 ft and you have to be directly in front of the device.  The sound is excellent, which is what we were going for. We have enjoyed using it very much."
4,"These are very nice. We considered getting our grandson beats, but these are just as good.<br />The box said a carry bag was included, but that was not in the box. It would have been handy for him."
5,Great stand. Easy to set up . A couple of screw and your up and running . I want to buy a second one for future use .
5,"Instead, set them up as the main speakers in a 2-channel stereo setup.  They rock!  Simple as that.  Yeah, \\""only\\"" 60 Hz., but damned if it ain't an honest 60 Hz.!<br /><br />These speakers are really excellent for their size.  They will almost take pretty much all you can throw at them (their impedance is 8 ohms, and they'll handle up to 125W peak), and at slightly saner listening levels, they are sweet, solid, punchy, balanced, articulate, clear, and just plain fun to listen to!<br /><br />Get a pair, and try them for yourself.  Jazz, Rock, Classical, these really deliver.  Dub? Hip-Hop?  They only go down to 60 Hz.!  Toss in a sub, and you'll be doing pretty good!  Otherwise, turn up the bass a little bit (they're only 5\\"" drivers), and let them take you away!<br /><br />Solid build, and solid sound.  In my opinion, you really can't go wrong with these speakers.  They are that good!<br /><br />Update:<br />As I've been listening to these speakers, I am realizing that I really don't need to turn up the bass in order to get a solid sound!  Even at lower volume levels, levels where you might consider switching in the Loudness button, I find that when leaving the Loudness off, and leaving the tone controls set flat, the sound is still very full and balanced, and the bass is solid without being boomy or otherwise smearing the rest of the sound!  And when turned up with the tone controls flat, the sound is balanced, solid, and punchy; the percussive nature of the music comes through naturally.<br /><br />Listening to Beethoven's 5th Symphony, the second movement, the quiet Double Bass notes are deep, rich, detailed, and solid.  Listening to Steely Dan's song, \\""Babylon Sisters,\\"" the sound is percussive, deep, sparkly, and clean!  Dave Brubeck's \\""Take 5\\"" is detailed, and natural.  The bass sounds woody, deep, and very clean, and the drums are sharp and solid, with clean, and detailed cymbal sounds!<br /><br />I keep focusing on the bass, and the percussive nature of the sound because that's what usually gets compromised in a small speaker system.  In my opinion these speakers are well designed, and well executed.  They continue to amaze me!"
2,"Okay I have this hooked up to my hdtv,av receiver, dish VP722, floor speakers. I like it everything works fine,TV shows on sound bar.But...when I watch a BD, I lose audio from my floor standing speakers. BD audio on sound bar only. Have this hooked up per manual.Sound bar HDMI1 in to BD. Cant get audio on BD AND floor standing speakers. I will upgrade this review if and when I get this working."
5,"I love this player it is small, the navigation is easy, downloads from my library are easy. I listen to books alot and the ability to bookmark is essential."
5,"You don't have to spend a lot of money on a high quality Subwoofer cable. Mediabridge has created a high quality, sturdy Subwoofer cable that produces excellent low frequency sound. This connects my Yamaha Home Theater Receiver RX-A810 to my Klipsch SW350 Subwoofer and it sounds great. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to save money on quality cables."
5,"Love these headphones...I just can't see myself buying expensive headphones (over $50+), I just enjoy listening to music on iTune on my iMac and these really fit the bill for me; good bass, clear vocal tone and all around a comfortable headphones...I recommend these if you're not into really expensive headsets."
5,UP DATE AT BOTTOM. ordered the polk psw 1010 on a wedsney and receved it on a friday . im going to use it with the fluance 7.0 surrond system with the yamaha rxv671 recevier .sub is low cost  price wise . could drop inhertz down to 25 . but for the price and make . you cant really beat it.  quite a few years ago i had a yamaha rx 491 with paradigm atoms cc150 center and adp 10 sub with ads 100 dipole surrounds . for home theater and music . i still have the paradigme sub and sepreat crossover the polk comes close to low lows not quit as solid and wall and floor shakeing  . but once again its pretty inpressive for the price . ide recemend it to a friend and others to buy it its vertisatel and works from music to ht systems. if your on a buget its a good choice and it comes in a few different colors. not bad . mh. ill keep an up date. posted. UP DATE . its 5/10/13. sub still works great. like i said i have paradigm subs. this will not go down as low or play as loud . but/ this only has a 100 whatt rms amp 50 watts contiouns. my paradigms have 300 and 200. thats a big difference. i also have def tech 8040s with built in 300 watt subs . in each speakers  this is my main ht system . the polk is in our bed room with a yamaha rx-v 671 . and jamo speakers. alot of people dont take the tim to set up the speakers or sub . most just set it where they can plug it in and turn the knobs till they stop. not good. then say its muddy it clips it s not loud ect. all im saying is you have to spend a little time messing with it its a very decent sub for the price. theres subs out that cost more than this and sound terrable. i ran the yapo on the yamaha and set the speakers to larg to see . then changed them to small reran it and what a difference . it taks some time. no there not audiophile but for what they are and the price its a good buy. im pleased with it and would buy another one which im going to buy two more for my sons for there rooms . yes they have some port noise when pushed at higher volumes but the amp is 50 watts contiounus  100 is rms. i use it for ht and music and play it loud at times . it was designed for somuch and thats all. im pleased and would recamed this for someone on a budget or wants to keep cost down . i  bought it on a whim it was cheap and looked decent . its polk . so there you have it . good luck .
5,"I really have no way of testing the quality of this voltage regulator. All I know is that it's much bigger and heavier than I was expecting. I guess I didn't look at the specs closely enough.<br /><br />It's 20.8cm x 13.2cm x 11.6cm and weighs a whopping eight pounds.<br /><br />For years I had an APC UPS. The only annoyance was the battery doesn't last more than a year or two, and it was expensive to replace (the shipping on it was expensive, too). However, it was a very smooth sailing for my computer, over those years. I think the most important thing you can do is buy a quality motherboard and then protect it with a good voltage regulator such as this one. My feeling is that if you don't, you might get that one power surge when you weren't paying attention and it will weaken the board to where you'll have periodic blue-screen problems from then on out for years to come. I certainly don't trust the standard surge protectors which can be bought at the department store.<br /><br />I just did $600 worth of upgrades to my computer and I needed to protect my investment."
5,Worked as expected
4,"I got these stand for half off when my order for the HTB3 stands was cancelled. Shipping was extremely fast (ordered friday received on Monday).  These stands are really easy to put together and are very sturdy with a nice hidden wire feature. I am not impressed with the speaker mounting brackets. The \\""L\\"" bracket is actually a little large for my Sony satellitte speakers but I was able to compensate with a large rubber washer.  Overall I like the speaker stands, I just wouldn't pay the regular price for them."
5,"I have had this scale for abot 4 or 5 years now and it still works, even on the same battery it came with.  I dont travel much so i have not used it much since I have had this, but I have lent it to friends and family.  It seems to be pretty accurate and is super easy to use.  It stays in my luggage and I love it."
5,My husband and I both have this armband and it works great.  Hardly knew it was on the arm.  We could easily access all the functions of our iPod Nanos.  Grantwood did  a great job on this little number.
5,"It's an HDMI cable. It works as it should, and it was relatively inexpensive."
3,"Lightning took out my entire home theater system. I replaced it with Onkyo HT 9300 THX 7.1 system. The Onkyo service technician said, &#34;NEVER count on surge protectors&#34;. I had to trash a new integrated amp."
4,"Although this clock radio does what I want it to, it does not have presets for changing radio stations, I have to turn up the volume to play my I pod shuffle, and it would be nice if the CD player would pick up where I last listened to the disc.  It is simple, the display is large and visible, and the clock easy to set."
5,When my original adapter broke I stared looking for a new one with HP and until I found this one I was beginning to thing I would have to shell out over $50 for a new one. Works perfectly in my DV900 laptop. It doesn't seem to be the highest quality adapter however it comes with a 12month warranty so how can you go wrong?
4,"It really is what the pictures show So pay close attention.  There are NO BUTTONS on this stereo other than the on and off switch in the back.  There in no even a way to manipulate the volume control or any other functions.  However, the sound is awesome compared to most price comparable Bluetooth speakers on the market.  I actually bought it from a local store, so I was able to open it and see it before buying,  The construction seems to be solid for the price, although much stronger and sturdier it really looks like a shoe box with a full size stereo sticker in the front. I LIKE THE FACT THAT IT'S RECHARGEABLE, and it is supper light, it is perfect for BBQ, camping, beach trips or just portable around the house speakers."
5,I am blown away by the sound clarity and volume this little guy produces.  Battery last a few hours for me at the volume I need.  It full charges quicker than my android phone.  The seller was quick and the product arrived as detailed.
2,great headphones until they broke
5,Tanku
3,Little hard to set up. But works good
5,"I don't have an hdmi output on my laptop, so the only way to watch movies and view pictures from it on my tv is to hook it up vga. This cable is long enough to be able to view what I'm displaying with my laptop on my lap. Good quality, value priced product!"
2,i bought this at rite aid hoping to fix my game and i was excited and then later disappointed it didnt do what it said im pissed.
5,"All though this product was mainly intended for I-pods and I-phones, I don't have any kind of apple product and never will. This Sound system plays well with my 48gb Droid Razr through the auxiliary input and my speaker out even comes with a short cord for it . But I would how ever suggest buying an extra long one so you can have better range of motion to change the songs with a longer reach to be the Dj. The remote works well at distances while in a field with in direct site .Awesome song and very deep bass and loud clear volume ! awesome buy for the cash !"
5,"I have previously owned several universal remotes and I would have to say hands down this beats all.  The software is the easiest to use and set up.  The last remote I owned was a Sony RM-AX4000 and, although it was decent and I love the sony name and the quality that goes with it, the remote was to heavy and bulky.  The 880 logitech is a little pricey but well worth it if you are a home entertainment geek like I am."
5,Love this speaker. Great sound. I use it all the time.  I just bought 2 more of these for gifts. Great gift idea.
1,ordered in error. misread info
5,I purchased this HDMI switch due to a surround sound addition to my home theater and the surround sound device only had one HDMI input. I had tried 2 other switches and non performed well until this one. This works automatically when changing from cable to Blue ray or gamming system. I would purchase again
5,Easy to set and works perfectly. I can see the number in the dark. Just what I wanted for waking
4,"They were great, but they were the wrong brand 4 me. I would have 2 give this product 4 out of 5."
5,"It's a cable! Looks like one, acts like one, works like one."
5,"Light weight. Versatile. It's a hardrive you can carry with you all the time. I work from different location and this little gadget is a blessing. Transfer files back and forth in seconds. With xPod you can use it with any PC. You just need a firewire card. You can also hook it up in your car with an adapter and you won't need any lame cd/md-changers. The price is a little steep but so far there's nothing out there you can compare with it. If you want something that's both sleek and practical, this is it."
3,"Its a pretty good receiver for the price, my only problem is that it turns itself on and off at its own will."
4,works great
4,My Toshiba G-35 is about 6 years old now and about a month ago my power cord frayed from improper storage/kitten. Being that this model of computers requires a 120w charger - I was out of luck with finding a replacement in stores. You could pay $60+ for one from the Toshiba factory but if you use a surge protector the Techno brand works just fine. Also worth mentioning - customer service was exceptionally helpful and responsive to emails.
5,Very well thought out..Bought 1 then another If I had a third tv would buy again. One Samsung on Vizio.. no problem with either one fitting units. Weight of TV no issue. Had to custom drill one as studs were odd spacing from corner..<br />Very very happy with units.<br />Would be nice if they offered a bolt on mount for a satellite receiver. Had to weld one up for each unit fits underneath tight to TV so always aimed right. Great addit
5,"PROS:<br />Comfy. Wearable for long periods of time (multiple hours). Sometimes I leave them on even when my musics stopped playing just because it's a serviceable noise reducer.<br />Deep, rich bass. Really fleshes out a lot of music.<br />Tangle-free cord.<br />Should something ever happen to my pair - the price isn't much to replace.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Might have to adjust EQ if you're trying to avoid too much bass, as it really amplifies it. Ive listened to dance/electronic, metal, and hip-hop, and it all sounds real good with these. I'm no audiophile though.<br />They look rather comically big when wearing them, but I only use them at my desk or at home anyways.<br />Ear pads get a little warm in warm weather. Tolerable though."
5,"The prior reviews very accurate. Light, not too tight , and comfortable. Good sound quality. Would easily recommend.  Especially as travel headphones chose these over similarly priced beats."
4,"This is a very nice case for the price. It holds the KOBO securely and you can flip it back and secure with the magnet while you're reading. You can easily access all of the buttons with KOBO in its case; however, you have to move one of the straps to turn it on. Worth the money to protect your device!"
4,Worked great then broke because it was left on the charging dock. battery shows as full when plugged in and when its removed from charging dock - it goes back to low battery.
2,"Let me preface this review by saying I have just started using this new remote (RC71) after years of using the \\""regular\\"" DirecTV remote (RC65 universal IR remote).<br /><br />First off, the back of the remote is a hard plastic with no sort of grippy texture or rubber coating so it is quite slippery, especially when you're  using the top portion of the remote, which includes all the buttons except the number pad. I don't watch much live TV these days. I record everything and watch it later which means I rarely use the number pad and my hand is almost always towards the top of the remote using the playback functions (guide,list, menu, play, pause, record, etc). Also, because of the design of this remote and the fact that I use the top half almost exclusively, I always feel like I'm about the drop the remote because of how small it is and how it balances in my hand.<br /><br />Another thing that really irks me is there is no STOP button like the old remote had and like you'd expect to find on a remote control that is supposed to be used to play recorded shows and movies. I'll tell you how I used my old remote so you can see why this is a problem for me. lets say I'm watching a recorded show and I want to stop it because I want to finish it later or im in the mood to watch another recording. I should be able to press STOP but there isn't a STOP button. So now I have to either hit pause (so the show doesn't continue to advance)  then either hit the EXIT button (which takes you out to live TV) or hit LIST button then find another show to watch and play it. I can just hit the EXIT button to take me out of the show but that brings me to live TV and not to the list with my recordings.<br /><br />Yet another thing that ticks me off is I can't delete a recording that I'm currently watching without going into the list. With the Old remote and old DVR, I was able to just hit the delete button and the currently playing recording would delete. Now I have to go to my list, go downto the recording I want to delete and press the delete button to get rid of it. Why all the extra steps?<br /><br />With all this said, I should mention that I just upgraded to the DirecTV Genie. Maybe some of these issues are related to how the Genie works and not the remote itself. Either way, this remote does not feel good in the hand."
5,"Does exactly what I need. Splits my audio from my camera from mono to stereo. Make sure you get the right one, this one is for male to female. Awesome price."
5,"Worked for me and my iPhone 5S as advertised so am happy with that, but I can no longer use it as I have upgraded to the iPhone 6 Plus. The interior is just a tiny bit too small, even if I remove the 6 from its case. Not the manufacturer's fault, so 5 stars for the product, but thought people should know."
3,I like APC
5,"I got this converter to use with a legacy analog Bose Lifestyle 12 surround sound system (circa 1996).  The Bose only has red/white analog inputs, and my LG flatscreen and Cisco cable box only have digital audio outputs.  So I purchased an optical cable, ran it from the Cisco to the Orei converter, then ran red/white audio cables from the Orei to the Bose.  Everything works perfectly.  Just for grins, I also ran a coax digital from another Seiki flatscreen, to the Orei (has to throw the little selector switch on the Orei), and then to the Bose, and it also works perfectly.<br /><br />I am very happy with this purchase."
5,"Bought 2 pair for media room for use with both HDTV surround system and conventional 2-channel stereo system.  What an improvement over our floor model speakers (front channel) and bookshelf (rear channel) set-up.  A must-have component, though, is a quality sub-woofer.  Although the ATC6 does a great job with the high bass thru mid-range thru highs, the sub-woofer really completes the package.  Installation in existing construction takes thought and careful planning; be ready to modify your plans as you encounter problems, and take your time."
5,This is a great cable at a very reasonable -I saw similar cable in best buy for many times the price of this cable.
5,"Took only a few minutes to install. Item may cost a little more, but remember, you usually only get what you pay for. Picture is sharp and clear now and no flashing lights on the TV."
5,This was the second time that I purchased this product and I was happy with the first 5 batteries.
5,Cables arrived in 1 week. Working perfectly.
1,This wire looks and feels well made and solid but the signal goes out and the connection from the computer to the TV gets lost.  It happens after about 20 minutes of viewing and it happens every time. This wire is way too cheap for the length and I should have known better.  I wish I could return it but I threw away the packaging.  Do not buy this piece of junk.
5,"Great little speaker.  If you want deep booming bass (like I do), this won't deliver.  But if you want something at a good price that will blow your phone out of the water and is just as portable--this fits the bill.  Little distortion at max volume.  I tried everything from Smetana to Glitch Mob, and this little guy does reasonable justice to all genres.  I just got it today, and so far it's my kitchen, office, bathroom, and porch speaker.  Loving it."
5,Works great
3,"This clip broke while just lying in my gym bag!  Can't say if it was a freak accident or just poorly built, but won't complain too much since it was not expensive - it did work ok while it lasted."
5,Excellent. Although it doesn't fit properly to small projectors
1,"Piece of junk it broke in 2 months, DO NOT BUY COMPLETE CRAP!!!!! It looks like it is well made but the circuitry inside sucks, was told by 4 different TV and Cable installers they are not even made by Motorola.<br /><br />Seller: Fast, Perfect Condition A+++++++++++++++"
2,Audio quality fine.  Wires a bust.  These hair thin wires caused a failure in my left earbud within 4 months of purchase.  Trying to get company to help.  Do not recommend.
5,"This mount is excellent.  The high quality design and easy of installation, due to more tons of included mounting hardware, really make for a great experience.  Not to mention, our 40\\"" Toshiba HDTV looks fabulous mounted on the wall with the wires concealed, as compared to sitting on our coffee table.  This is a great buy and substantially cheaper than other retailers or if you buy it directly from a TV Installation Representative.  We're psyched with our purchase! Thanks again Amazon & Sanus!"
5,Easy set up. Works great! I didn't need to use remote. It switches between equipment without a hitch. No need to spend more.
5,Love them!!
5,Works good
4,This clock is very nice but takes a little time to set.
5,"E-ink displays do not require a back light in order to display an image, this results in a less stressful experience for your eyes. Also, e-ink displays are easier to view in sunlight, this device is perfect for anyone that wants to read outdoors and have a large volume of books at your finger tips. These displays only use power to update the image on the display. Once the image has been updated, the display no longer consumes precious battery life. Meaning this device can actually last weeks/months on a single charge. The draw back is due to the update once scheme, the device may feel a bit sluggish to people use to tablets. This device was only designed as a reading device, therefore a quick response time should not be an issue.<br /><br />This device exceeded my expectations, easily copy and pasted my pdfs from my computer onto the device in a few mouse clicks. I would recommend this device to people who hate reading on LCD screens and prefer physical copies of books."
3,"I ordered one of these from two different vendors.<br />One arrived quickly but they are the same product. Functional but unattractive. So it works as advertised, it's just not pretty."
5,Im sad to here they are discontinuing these so I purchased as many as I could.
5,These sleeves are pretty much the same as ordinary paper sleeves with the transparent circular window. The only difference is the price is WAY WAY less that buying from a local outlet in a pack of 50 or something like that. Perfect for churches that produce DVDs or CDs of the service.
5,"It's amazing how much sound Bose can get out of a little bitty speaker like this.  It was a choice between the jawbone or this one, but I have Bose noise cancelling headsets, and have heard the sound quality of the full-sized desktop speaker and chose the Bose. It's a little pricey but you really do get wat you pay for. I also got the travel case. I'm consistently amazed when my husband is playing music thru this little speaker and how crystal clear it sounds in another room of the house."
5,I get this out when I have to wait somewhere such as a ball game movie or other places. It makes the time pass faster and you don't mind the wait if yhou have something to do.
5,works well
2,"May be the worst antenna I have owned. I purchased this as a secondary antenna for my bedroom TV so that I could be done with Cable for good. No matter what I tried, I could not get a signal from this antenna. I even dangled it out the window but no results. My $25 antenna I bought at Radio Shack several years ago gives me an HD signal and about 10 channels. The only reason I gave this 2 stars was because of the signal extender that it came with. When I added it to my existing antenna, I received an additional 7 channels. This antenna may work for you, but it sure didn't work for me."
5,This was a gift for my neice and she is very happy with it ! That's why !!!!! I listen to and the sound was great !
5,"It's a very handy item for older adults. My 87 year old mother was having all kinds of trouble with her old remote, so I got her one of these and so far, so good. The programming was easy, the setup went well. It's a neat little gadget that makes using a TV simpler. She's using it with a Comcast digital adapter and the preset code didn't work, but one of the alternate ones worked fine. For anyone with dexterity issues, eyesight issues, or general confusion, this is a great option. It's also a good option for kids as you can program it for just the kid friendly channels and even a very young child can use it with ease."
5,I lost my adapter when I moved from one apt to another. I looked up various chargers and found the Pwr+ version to be the same and cheaper than the Bose version. I've not found any problems and look forward to many years with my new Bose SoundDock power adapter by Pwr+
5,It has the power to charge an ipad and a phone at the same time. The only drawback if the bright green led light strip on the top. If you use it in a bedroom you'll need to mask the light with some tape (I used black electrical tape).
5,These are well worth the money and used in Xbox controllers they stay charged a few days with non stop play
5,Amazing sound in a convenient stand.  Very functional clock displays with reasonable brightness settings.  The &#34;night light&#34; settings are a nice touch.
1,Does not work.  TV does not provide required amperage? through the USB Bus to power the Roku
5,"I hesitated to buy this speaker, since I already had an external speaker for my mp3 player. But I was never really happy with the iHome iHM9U I had. It had been an impulse buy a couple years ago. When I plugged this Altec product in, I really wish I hadn't waited so long. No comparison between the sound. The iM227 is much louder, much clearer sound. Richer tones, and everything else about it just rocked. Rather than sounding muffled, it filled the room with decent sound. Yes, my home theater system is still nicer, but this Orbit speaker sounds more like it than like the dumb little pansy speaker I had before. And it's smaller, and easier to transport. What's not to love? I'm convinced this is the best product available for anywhere near this price.<br /><br />Just get it, you won't regret it.<br /><br />UPDATE: There's another (newer?) model of this product that includes 3 AAA batteries and an adapter that will connect the unit to devices with a 2.5mm plug (this model doesn't include batteries or the adapter). And, it's cheaper than this listing on Amazon (right now). I believe that other than those extra included items, it's an identical product. Check out the [[ASIN:B006KZ0R1Q Altec Lansing Technologies IMT227 OrbitM Ultra Portable Speakers]]. I'd suggest getting that instead."
5,Best headphones ever and too easy to use. Very durable as well. Beats by Dre are great but these are better.
5,"Van a leer mil reseas con decibeles y cosas similares; van a leer cosas raras y comparaciones odiosas.. si me permiten resumirlo: hace ya casi 4 aos estos son los auriculares que lideran ventas y rankings de cualquier revista de viajeros frecuentes porque pese a que quiza""los bajos no sean perfectos\\"" son los que mejor bloquean el sonido externo. Son los que mejor se conectan a un telefono y solo tienen como contra el necesitr baterias en vez de usar recargables :)<br /><br />En definitiva, no busquen otros :)"
5,Great fit for my G-Box connection. Really love it.
5,"I bought this to replace an old iPod mini. The battery in this is incredible - I can go for weeks without charging it, and I use it at least five days a week.    You can definitely still use iTunes with this Walkman. It can play M4A files, which are what type of files are created by iTunes when you import a cd. If you buy music from the iTunes store, they will be M4P files (unless they are the new DRM-free format.) You can just burn your M4P files onto a cd and import the cd back into iTunes. You can open your iTunes music folder and drag and drop the songs onto your Walkman as though it were a memory stick. Very handy."
5,"The 4th generation Apple iPod Touch is the best music player out there in my opinion! I highly recommend it. The camera is pretty good; it takes pictures and video in 1080 pixels (1080p). Also, it is pretty fast. I wouldn't recommend any other music player. This is the one to get!"
5,Received as described! Fast shipping!!!
4,"Bit short on battery life but that seems to be par for the course with mini amps in this class. Where the E6 still shines is in its low noise floor.  I generally use this class of amps with IEMs while on the road but o  I have compared this with the E3 and the newest Rocky and even with bass boosted I have a nearly silent background with the E6 and 16 Ohm IEMs.  The Rocky, in comparison, has quite a bit of noise that persists with 32ohm Grados with amplification and bass on. This may be a function of having bass boost, amplification, and a microphone circuit crammed in there. But, there you go.  If you don't need the mic and you don't have any particular preference for the controls (the E3 is significantly harder to manage in your pocket or such) the E3 seems to be the better package for pure listening. A solid worker at an acceptable price point, which seems to be the hallmark of Fiio."
1,"This was great for the first few times I used it. Then it totally broke for no reason whatsoever. I couldn't get it to work and iTunes didn't recognize the iPod when I plugged it into the computer. Seems like others have had great experiences, so maybe mine was a dud? Thankfully it has been less than 30 days, so I can return the defective iPod.  I'm going to order another one and see if it's better."
4,Exactly wht I wanted almost. Looks great. No instructions though. But not that hard to figure out. Overall good product. If u need a pic email me at hannah.rutherford13@yahoo.com
4,Does everything I needed it to do. I only use the basic features however and I need atleast two more
5,I needed this to play music and videos on my phone through receiver. Works well. Meets the expectations
5,Great for 50 inch LED TV
1,"Really, I don't ask much of a SATA cable other than to actually function. This is pure crap, there is so much excess of the molded rubber end material that it leaked into the the black connector portion during manufacture.  The cable does not fully plug far enough into any devices or the motherboard enough to function (or clip for that matter).<br /><br />I highly recommend purchasing another brand."
2,"Video converstion from DP to HDMI works fine, but the audio is lost.  This does NOT convert the audio channel from DisplyPort to HDMI."
5,Easy assembly and are using them to store cd cases that I also purchased from amazon. I have filled the cases with clear stamps for card making.
4,this product is in my view a very good. The powerful sound it gives out is just great.I look forward to endless sound quality.
5,"This is one AWESOME MP3 player. It has so many features and the fact thats they are also easy to use makes it even better. I may have had it for a few hours, but that's all I (and most people) need to operate this player to it full extent. I have made a pros and cons list as well. <br /> <br />PROS: <br />MENU SYSTEM - This is GREAT! It's so easy to use because of the icons and the scoller button. One of those players that you could operate out of the box without the manual.  <br /> <br />SIZE - It's VERY small for an MP3 player. I can't say it's an amazing size because I came from an Panason SV-SD80 (THAT player, by the way, is INCREDIBLY TINY! The size of a psotage stamp). But the size DEFINITELY pocketable.  <br /> <br />SCREEN - It has a nice blue backlit screen. Some people says it's too small, but I don't think so. It displays the battery life, time elapsed, type of EQ (equalizer), and song name (NOT artist). The only showing the song name is a little bad, but it doesn't seem to bother me much. Technically, you DO get the see the artist's name because right before you select the song, it displays the file name. If you put the artist's name in the file name, you get the see it for a split second.  <br /> <br />Accessories - It comes with Creative earbuds, a belt clip, and an armbamd. The earbuds are nice sounding, but they are so big and thick in my ears that it hurts them after 5 minutes. The belt clip is rubber, which does WONDERS to the plastic surface of the MuVo. It grips the player. Plus, the way the belt slip is designed, you must stick in the key ring side of the player, so the MuVo's keyring goes into the keyring hole. That way, the player cannot fall out. That was hard to explain; it's something that you must buy the player or see the belt clip in order to understand. The armbad is actually nice to use. Not hard to use and the player is VERY safe. To use the armband, you have to use it with the belt clip, even safer.  <br /> <br />SOUND - The sound was GREAT when I first used it. Then it got even better when I setup my settings for the custom EQ. NOW it sounds AMAZING. Plus, now I can actually hear nice music coming from Sony Street style headphones (I couldn't before on my Panasonic)  <br /> <br />TRANSFER - SOOOOOO FAST! The USB 2.0 is amanzing when it's on an MP3 player AND a thumb drive. I LOVE the drag and dropp ability of the Muvo. My panasonin had to use Realplayer to transfer the songs. ABSOLUTELY ANNOYING! Now I have no fustration. Drag and drop and I outta the house.  <br /> <br />FM RADIO AND VOICE RECODER- GREAT I just autoscan for the radio station. I don't know how many presets it can save total, but when I autoscaned, I got 16. still impressive. I don't have picky ears, so the FM radio recorder was nice to have and listen to. Voice recoder is nice but not high quality. Can't expect much from an MP3 player.  <br /> <br />PRICE - I think it is a plus because you get all these things all together in one packeage: MP3 player, Voice recoder, FM radio/recorder, and flash drive. Plus, the original 256 MB MuVo TX that had NO FM radio was more expensive than this one. Funny, huh?  <br /> <br />CONS: <br />NOT RECHARGEABLE OUT OF THE BOX - It didn't come with rechargeble batteries. It was kind of sucky, but I cant juss buy either ALOT of AAA batties, or a rechargeble battery kit.  <br /> <br />NO LANYARD - It didn't come with a neck strap. I kind of like those because if you don't want to use the belt clip or armband, but still hands free, a neck strap would be nice.  <br /> <br />NO DISPLAY OF ARTIST'S NAME <br /> <br />SIZE - I had said that size was a PRO of the player, but it's also a CON. When you separate the player and the battery pack to plug in the player, you'll notice that the player will take up the space of 2 PORTS. Kind of annoying for some people since for me, I don't have that many USB peripherals. I'm just telling those people who DO have all USB ports filled and a USB HUB. Other than that,size is still a PRO <br /> <br />Memory - Although 256 MB is actually ALOT more than I expected, it would be nice to have a 512MB version or even a 1GB version of this AWESOME player. 256 MB is definitely plenty for the average user and even above the average user.  <br /> <br />All and all, VERY nice player. When I rate this player, I have no doubt in my mind taht is deserves a 5."
5,good
5,"I purchased my first Sony ICF 79W several years ago; I have not experienced no problem with the product. I recently viewed an amazon.com ad offering the radio, and I decided to buy two, now I have a total of three (3); I use all of them."
5,"Before I had this I kept plugging in and unplugging cords for my iPhone, stereo, headphones, pc Speakers etc. This device really simplifies all that and the audio quality that passes through it is still very good."
4,I bought this for my wife and it works flawlessly. It is rounded and does not fit well in her back pocket so she wants a flatter one...but it's a great deal.
5,"It works well.  Only comment is to look where it comes from.  Mine came directly from &#34;Clever Edgar&#34; in Hong Kong, so it took about two weeks to get here in spite of Prime shipping"
4,sounds better than another wireless speaker i have. the only gripe i have is it does not advance the songs on my iphone...not a deal breaker the sound and base make up for that
5,"If you're looking at these headphones, you must already know about head-fi. A good consumer would have read their reviews, and if you're like me, been terrified of the anemic low-end.<br /><br />There is NO NEED TO FRET.<br /><br />My primary pair of headphones before I picked these up were the Sony MDR-XB500 (XB for Xtra bass, bro). Transitioning between them does not make me feel a lack of bass. It is absolutely less dramatic bass response, but I don't feel like I'm missing anything. Bass tracks I fell in love with on my Sony's (Dead Man's Tetris by Flying Lotus is currently playing) sounds great and full, with clarity and articulation that doesn't need the &#34;Xtra Bass&#34; bloat.<br /><br />AND THE SOUNDSTAGE! Good lord, these feel so enormous! The way things move feels effortless, and the sound envelops you like a blanket fresh from<br />The dryer.(that is NOT saying it's a warm can; imagery only)<br /><br />These headphones are clear too! The texture of woodwinds comes across so exquisitely, i can feel the texture of the reed on my lips.<br /><br />I had concerns about the treble reproduction on these headphones, and I will say the treble (the hanging ring of bells for example) can be a tad aggressive, but by no means a deal breaker. That agressiveness has been defining in certain tracks, showing me more of what I was there to see.<br /><br />Lastly, I was concerned about the need of a headphone amp with these cans. While i'll still be buying an amp (little dot 1+) everything you've read has been experienced through my iPhone. I'm very excited to see how these will sound with an amp, but It's great knowing they're not lifeless without one!<br /><br />As My first pair of audiophile quality headphones, I feel these are a great selection, but I was almost scared out of buying them after reading reviews on head-fi. I'm glad I went with my gut."
4,"Too early to give a full review of the SR605, although I can say that set up has been very easy and so far DVD sound is quite good.  I like the automatic sound adjustment on first use.  My complaint, or question for anyone that might have ideas on how to resolve, is that it does not seem to work as passthrough for Xbox 360 using component output.  I hooked Xbox component output into SR605, HDMI output from SR605 to Aquos LCD TV.  No video image.  I wonder if this is due to XBOX outputting in 1080p, and SR605 converter having difficulty passing 1080p from component input to HDMI output.  Onkyo support site has no answer to this.  To resolve, I hooked Xbox component output directly to TV, but this means I have to switch TV input every time.  One of the big advantages of SR605 is that you use it as the input/output switch, theoretically not having to switch TV input to change sources.  Now for my, uh, kids (cough, cough) to play Xbox, we have to switch both SR605 and TV inputs.  Any solution to this, or is this just a SR605 flaw?"
5,"This is real copper wire - not plated aluminum. Also appears to be actual 12 gauge. Nice thick insulation also.  BTW: I echo what has been said - you don't need fancy speaker cables (Monster, etc.)... this works great and will deliver the power to the speakers without loss."
5,Great product.  Good quality for what it is.
3,Buttons are mixed up on the remote and it did not come with a power pack.
4,"While I'm no big fan of typically over-priced and over-hyped Monster products, I'll readily concede that this beats any of the 9 or 10 other splitters I tried. I see comments here from users who say they can't see a difference with this product; my comment to them is that they need a better tv. I also noted one reviewer who somehow heard that this splitter can't be used with CATV (It can, and I've been using mine for over a year with my digital cable hookup). Advantages: less noise and grain than others I've used, and channels at the frequency band extremes look much better than my cable company's \\""free\\"" piece of junk. Most notably, this splitter maintains excellent image contrast and has no visible chroma effects that I can see. Few splitters can manage all this. The only product I've tried that might beat this is a $[...] job whose brand I don't remember (probably because I ain't spending $[...] on a splitter, for any reason). Even if you're not crazy about Monster in general, you'll get your money's worth here. I'm using two in my setup with a CELabs booster amp."
1,Crap. I just went to Ireland last week and had my converter/adapter and was planning to use this along with it. It broke. Thank God I had a backup or I wouldn't have had access to anything.
5,Awesome for the price .. i have no complaints ....<br /><br />I tried other brands too that were more expensive than JLab but did not sound as good.
5,"Works great, thank u"
4,"So, I ordered these mainly because I've been stuck with my original iPhone headphones for a while now, and if you've ever actually used those you know those things suck. They hurt your ears and the sound quality could be a lot better. So, I was looking around and found these. I thought they looked cool, the zipper thing is a cool idea, and the fact that they would block out other sound was an added bonus. So, I ordered them and they arrived on time. And after using them for a couple hours, I really like them a lot! The zipper part is convenient when putting them in your pocket, they sound really great and block out all noise really well, and I like the fact that the ones I got glow in the dark."
2,"It doesnt have Mic. It doesnt like the description. Its still skullcandy, but it's just a regular one with no mic"
5,Sennheiser quality. Great open headphone. Easy set-up.
5,Performs as expected.
4,"This is an \\""old fashioned\\"" dial and pointer radio, lacking all of the features of a modern digital set... no preset stations, poor indication of the actual frequency that is tuned, no clock, no alarm. Somehow, it is still great fun to use!<br /><br />Band scanning has been a weak point of digital radios... the sound is usually muted while slewing through the frequency range, leaving just a tuning indicator light to show that a station has been found (most will not stop scanning on weak signals), or if not muted, a loud \\""chuffing\\"" noise is produced as the frequencies are scanned. With this set you just turn the knob and listen for stations!<br /><br />If you want to easily find, say the BBC on 5.975 Mhz a digital radio will get you there much faster, but for scanning the band to see what is on, the old dial and pointer still works quite well!<br /><br />For a similar but smaller and slightly less expensive radio, see my review of the Kaito WRX911. For a more expensive radio with \\""Double Conversion\\"", which eliminates \\""false signals\\"" on shortwave, see my review of the Kaito KA1107."
5,This is a great product and I recently emailed Blue Lounge and they are looking at making a large box for bigger surge protectors.
5,Great I love it and would say. If your looking for a nice receiver this is a good one. It works fine like advertise
4,"Very impresed with the unit, its look light and fragile,the cable is thin,1/8 cable connector is weak, more robust material will put this unit as a steal. The sound is what take the headphone apart, easily destroy the Bose type sound (i have a Bose headphone), the key? balance and clarity across the audio spectrum. Good recorded cd, lessloss mp3 of clasic, new age and instrumental music, with the HD 238 connected to a good dac (Audioengine d1) an you can get audiophile quality sound from any computer."
5,"I ordered this product so that I could utilize a switch that I needed to hook up my XBOX and Blu Ray.  Colors on the cable were exactly the same as what I saw on my \\""expensive\\"" cables.  Will be looking to buy more in the future."
5,"Six years ago when I got my first iPod I discovered that the standard ear buds would not fit my ears.  It wasn't that they were uncomfortable; they would NOT physically even fit in my tiny ears.  If I tried to put them in they would actively \\""pop\\"" (not just fall) out.  At the time I ordered a second set of ear buds from Apple -- these had three sets of padding in various sizes.  I thought surely the smallest size would work, but they did not.  I then searched for reviews of ear buds that would accommodate tiny ears, but to no avail.  I tried ordering a few other brands, but never had any luck.  I settled for some large, noise-cancelling headphones and just gave up my quest for a smaller solution.    I had concluded that my ears are just absurdly small and I was out of luck.  However, I recently renewed my search and found a couple of helpful lists of the \\""best\\"" ear buds for small ears (notably an excellent one from CNET: [...]).  I ordered two pairs: this brand and a JVC Marshmallow set that were both reviewed in the CNET article.  While I was prepared to be happy with the cheaper JVC set, I was glad I ordered both sets as these Thinksound Rain headphones had a much wider range of small tip sizes.  The JVC set, which had several positive reviews about being suitable for small ears, were not nearly small enough for me.  However, I could actually use the second smallest Thinksound Rain earpiece set!  It's a miracle!  If you are looking for ear buds with a range of options for truly tiny ears, these are terrific."
3,This item costs way too much for its sound quality but as my description says does its job. I have Vaf speakers for my ipod as well and they kill these but they also are twice the price with no radio.  I really recommend you try these for yourself before you buy as peoples ears for music vary wildly.   They are way smaller than pictured.  They realistically should be in the $99-125 range
5,I purchased this cable because I was not satisfied with the one I had - it was too long and was always a hassle to easily grab it in my car. This 3ft cable is perfect and works great with my iPhone 4S.
4,Works great with Epson 5030.<br />Only con wish it had better on off button.
1,"I used to absolutely love these mini players--easy to use.  Bought a few and kept them in various places like my car, work, and gym bag.  I have some older ones that are still working, but all the newer ones have broken within a few months of use.  I would say that they are not making them as sturdy as they used to be.  Also, I see a lot online listed as refurbished, which makes one wonder about quality as well.  Am now using a Bluetooth Headphone Adapter with my smartphone and that is working out better than having to go with another mp3 player (except for running, so I've starting listening to nature)."
1,The headset was defective and I returned it. I have used TV Ears in the past and liked them very much.
2,"These were really disappointing. We tried every setting on both of our laser printers and couldn't get a great image on them. They worked OK for the little project we were making for our son, but I wouldn't buy them again."
5,This is a great surge protector for your home or office.  We have frequent power surges in my building and this has helped save my electronics from ruin.  I even noticed a small drop in my electric bill because of the energy saving function.
5,Works great to charge my voyager in the car.  Glad I got it to charge up my blue tooth on the go.
3,mechanism to adjust tilt does not work well. Right side tilt arm adjusting screw and bolt gets stuck and cannot be moved.
3,"I was very excited when I first heard of this product. However, it didn't really met my expectations. After a half year of usage it's now resting on the bottom of the closet. It's quite OK, although the setup is a bit complicated.<br /><br />There are three reasons why I wouldn't recommend it:<br />1. It's just a device that wakes you up at the time you set. I can't even remember myself using some of the other features. Not to mention, it's a bit uncomfortable wearing such device on your hand when you go to sleep.<br />2. You can't really use it for polyphasic sleep. It will always tell you that you didn't sleep enough, because it doesn't accumulate the time you spend sleeping during the day.<br />3. Considering what I wrote above, it's a VERY expensive alarm clock."
5,I appreciate that there was a video showing exactly what it does. Took out of the box and does exactly what I want it to do.
5,"Sounds really good. Of course with a sound bar the music is load and the dialog is quiet, but overall I love it. It is the perfect size that I needed and sounds way better than the tvs audio"
5,Made a great tool to store pictures as a slideshow.
5,"I knew what I was looking for (had one of these that finally died and couldn't find another CD player anywhere nearly as good) and this was even better than I expected.  They said it wasn't in the original box but it looked perfectly unused, works perfectly, and I am finally happy with playing my books on CD's again.  In addition, the shipping was super prompt and securely boxed up."
3,"This was purchased to replace an original remote which had some buttons that failed.  This was identical to the original in EVERY way.  After two months, the channel return button failed.  This is one I use a lot to flip between two channels.  So far everything else works fine, and I can live with it.  The unit is inexpensive and if it really bothers me, I'll get another one just like it."
5,"I was not sure what I was getting into when I purchased these tips for my Sony headphones. These are by far the best improvement one can purchase for his/her headphones. The tips are a big improvement over the silicone standard tips. You experience an all new level of quiet when you use these tips. If you are a first time buyer, get the multipack."
4,"One of the best sets of headphones I've ever owned. Very sturdy, amazing bass and sound. I've grown a lot of hate for Dr. Dre because of how overpriced they are. All you need is a great sounding pair of headphones - and these are it. They sound absolutely beautiful on newer songs such as Imagine Dragons - Radioactive, however they sound great on all songs.<br /><br />Instead of wasting a ton of money on a pair of Dr. Dre's headphones, buy these.<br /><br />*EDIT*<br />After an honorable use of two-three years, I've gotten new headphones. I got the Skullcandy Crushers, and they're very nice. I decided to come back to these headphones as a spare but they sound like rubbish now. Was surprised at first, but these things are dirt old."
5,No complaints. Love it.
5,"Well, I haven't had a surge to trip it so who knows if it really works but I have peice of mind that I have some sort of protection.  I like the fact that it has LED lights telling me it is working and that the prong retract to take up less room and less likely to scratch up my laptap.  Over all I am happy with this purchase."
4,"I love it! I just listened while watching on TV to a baseball game(A's vs SF Giants) of course my team yhe A's lost. I loved listening while dh  played the piano and even talked on the phone and the TV was muted and we both enjoyed the game lol<br /><br />The volume buttons are easy enough to use, and turning it off was easy too. Not sure if I was exercising it would be as easy. I use my iPod for that I'm sure if I needed to I would use the headphones. It was a little tight but maybe there are instructions, I didn't read too closely, to loosen them. I love wireless don't you?<br /><br />The dh listened to music on the TV this morning also and really liked the sound of the music. I may get brave enough to try my iPod with it too. It was a Bluetooth hookup too.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to all the uses I'll get to use the headset for. The headphones were packaged interestingly--what a great plastic box! Grandson will probably have a good time with it lol"
5,"I often mount LCD TV's in bars and restaurants.  I have used all the brands of mounts.  This one is the best and easiest to install I have encountered.  The built in bubble level and hook for the cords are are really great!  If you want a mount, but this mount.  EasyMount is the only brand I now use professionally."
5,"super low price solid slim fit, and best of all protects the edges all around unlike most cases for the iphone! must have!"
5,These headphones are amazing!  They are great and worth the price and they are perfect for studying or working and do not want to he disturbed
4,"I bought this to connect my samsung galaxy s3 to my tv. works great! east to connect!<br />Only issue is that the phone switches from the 4G network to a roaming network, data charges. make sure you use your wireless."
3,These buggers are a little big but I enjoyed the sound and the experience -- that is until the left earbud broke about a year after I purchased them.  I am trying a different brand to replace them.
5,This was just as I hoped for as being a solid device with very smooth motion for our new 19&#34; TV.
5,comfy!
5,I got these to replace my V-MODA R's.  The Scosche's have been great.  I no longer have trouble with people being unable to hear me and the inbound audio quality is strong too.
4,"Shipped very quickly, DVDs are great quality.<br /><br />Very good price for these DVDs but the packaging was awful despite being frustration-free. There were several tabs broken from the clamshell so the lid doesn't sit/latch as well as I'd like. This is a bummer for me because there are 100 discs on the spindle meaning it's heavy so I have to be very careful when I pick it up."
5,HDMI are the best cables I've seen to date.
4,Connection is great. Only complaint is that the picture got fuzzier on my second screen. It may just be an issue with my display settings on my computer. It may be the adapter though but I do not know. Still a great adapter.
4,"This ear hook holds my headset it place alot better than the last one I had, and so far it's proving to be sturdy. The only problem I have is that it holds it so tight that it starts to hurt my ear after a while and I drive for a living which is the only reason why I keep it in. Not that big of a deal since it doesn't actually bruise my ear but that's why I gave it a 4."
1,This worked for about thirty minutes and then quit working.
5,Serves Same Purpose as the ones at wal mart thats $80 and up but this one is cheaper holds tv great no problem.
4,"The spring loaded buttons to release the cap could be larger.  It's slightly easier to use the Nikon-branded spring-caps, but I'm not about to pay $20+ for a lens cap.   <br /> <br />This works fine, but don't buy just one. (the shipping is comparable to the cost of the cap)."
4,"Thank you, have not used it yet to see if it is what I need. Good price."
5,Great deal and great product and fast ship!  Thank you!
3,"Pros:<br />1. Good for long distance running as they sit in your ear and need adjustments only a few times during the run.<br />2. The memory wire is very helpful and holds the earpiece in place with minimal irritation or creating any pressure on your ears<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. The \\""with Microphone/Remote\\"" may lead customers o believe that it has remote volume control, which it does not. That is why I give it 3 stars. The seller should come clean and make it clear in the technical summary on the top that it does NOT have remote volume control.<br />2. The headset inserted for a good fit gives you good sound and bass but if you are running it also creates a thumping feeling with every step you take. That will negate the advantage of \\""quiet listening\\"" and will make any runner to loosen the inserts a little bit. I do not have any other comparable in the ear headset that I can compare it to."
5,"The headset is as good as beats or better I love them they have grate sound, I connect to my iPod at night and fall a sleep with them on, they are more comfortable then my last headset, they so comfortable I don't even know I have them on, I love them. My son tried them and he liked them so much he bought a pear."
4,Works pretty well and easy to use. With its easy sliding volume adjustment it makes it easy to adjust with one hand without having to take your eyes off the road.
3,"I love this little guy, I love this MP3 player so much I've replaced it three times. But after today I realized that I need to find a new brand or model. I have had similar issues with all three, but the first lasted much longer, and the one I have now is already crapping out on me after a few months. One consistent issue is the headphone jack somehow becomes damaged and will only play music on either just the left side or just the right side of the headphone. If I fiddle with it it will play in both ears for a few minutes, but the time and attention it takes to have the music play in both ears continuously is not worth it. The player also freezes and other times will not turn on unless you press down the On button for several seconds.<br /><br />If you're looking for something that will last a couple of years, this MP3 player is not it."
5,"This is a replacement for the first Sony shower radio that I bought at least 20 years ago. I am so glad they still are making it.  AM/FM, NOAA Weather Channel, and timer feature all add up to a great radio that I have really come to depend on (especially when the power goes out)."
5,Great
3,"Used these for some long flights between Tokyo and Chicago, the noise canceling was antiquate and the sound quality for listening to music and movies was much improved over the airline provided headphones. These really blocked out the dine of the engines and cabin noise."
5,Great CDs.  We use a lot of them and these work well.
5,"The APC G5 unit is a very simple, straight forward device.  It does what it is supposed to do.  I've had it for a couple of months and have not had a single issue.  Prior to installation, I would here clicks from speakers, weird artifacts on screen when the kitchen incandescent lamps are switched on.  These are now memories of a somewhat distant past.    The LCD information is very helpful in determining load and other relevant info.  I would definitely purchase another one if I decide to build another room theater.    I have an Onkyo RC360 receiver, 46\\"" Samsung LCD, Pana Bluray, TW cable, HTPC and Harmony cradle plugged into this thing.    Cheers,"
4,"Great charger. The Soft Charge & Conditioning functions revived batteries my 'Energizer Family' charger said were bad. Those functions don't always engage on demand when i hit them, so sometimes i have to fiddle with it to get it to do what i want. still working out the order of operations, but it works great once i get it to obey.<br />-------------------------------------------<br /><br />Update: after 3 years i got a burning smell & very hot batteries. No longer charges. I'm tempted to get another but don't really like replacing electronics every few years."
5,Worked out perfectly.  We had a SONY portable CD / Radio and we lost the plug.  This plus works great and will safe us from using batteries.
5,"Easy to use and so far, works without fail."
5,"works wonderfully, now i can watch Netflix on my TV. I live where there's not Internet providers aside from satellite but my cell phone carrier works fine and i have an unlimited plan, very worthy investment."
4,"My system arrived last night and I had it set up in less than an hour. The sound quality is great. The system is attractive, which is a bonus. I only have two quibbles. First, the unit does not offer high-speed dubbing, which I will miss. And the control panel slides out of sight when you shut the unit off. If this feature doesn't work, the unit would be unable to function at all, presumably. Still, these are minor points compared to the system's many virtues. Much bang for the buck here."
5,"This speaker puts a ton of clean sound out! I was surprised at how loud it was, j had to turn it down in the shower! I've had it a week, use it daily and only charged it twice. Love this speaker , can't say enough good about it!"
2,The VSX 822 does not have the capability to switch a remote set of speakers on or off ...So why did they put a speaker switch on it? The 1022 does have &#34;A&#34; & &#34;B&#34;  speaker switching in addition to more speaker hook ups in the back of the unit.<br />I returned the 822 a bought the 1022 for $42.00 less????
4,Great quality cord. Sheath is durable with good visibility and feel.
5,"I purchased this protector instead of a standard power strip because I wanted to have more substantial protection for my electronics. I haven't been hit by lightning yet, and I hope I never need to find out how effective this device really is. the specs indicate it should handle whatever surges may arise. I do think highly of the metal construction, the ability to mount it to a wall or cabinet with screws since a lot of cords connected to it can pull/push/move the strip."
4,Pros:<br /><br />- Great sound for a such a small speaker.<br />- Great value for price.<br />- I really like the option of attaching multiple speakers in series.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Inferior performance with high bass sounds.
5,Product showed up on time and was the same as the picture. That is all you can ask for when ordering online.
5,So cute! gave as a gift and was very pleased.  I have the red eared one and love it!  great price too
5,good
1,Love my nook.  It worked great.  Until I had had it 13 months.  Then it wouldn't take a charge and the screen would freeze when the battery was still full.  They offered me a new nook for half price which means they know the nook doesn't last long.  I will look into other products.  I'm not going to pay 120.  for something with a non replaceable rechargeable battery that only lasts one year.
1,"I ordered this switch because I needed VGA and audio switching. The switch they send does not do audio and does not have any 3.5mm jacks as the description states.  I contacted the seller and he wanted to see pictures.  I sent him pictures and he said it matches the online description, which it clearly doesn't!  He did offer a refund, but to ship it back to Hong Kong would cost more than the switch, so to the junk pile it is."
5,"I love this player. It is durable, functional, and sleek. It is the second of its kind that I have purchased. This was purchased to replace a fairly new ipod that crapped out. I installed Rockbox firmware on it, and this player kicks butt. I have no real complaints about the player. I highly recommend this product."
5,I bought these batteries for my new flashlight. They charge pretty quickly and hold the charge for a good amount of time. At this price point you can't go wrong.
4,"I haven't actually used the adapter in Europe yet but I did check to see if my smart phone charger fit in the two plugs. The adapter  seems to be well made. lso, it arrived when the order said it would. So far I'm very satisfied."
5,"My dad wanted a new pair of headphones for his birthday, but said he didn't want anything over $50. These headphones were the best I found. The sound is very good, and the build is quite sturdy. If you only have $50 to spend, don't waste your money on anything else."
2,"I can see the point of a tool like this, and I suppose if I didn't have access to my [[ASIN:B003L1ZYYM AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI Cable (6.5 Feet/2.0 Meters)]] and a couple of adapters for my various Apple devices, I'd have tried harder to make it work. But since I do, the problems and disappointing performance of this Media Fusion TV Dock means it went right back in the box.<br /><br />I have an HD TV and, while not huge in relative terms, it was big enough to make the poor-quality graphics of the Nyrius display painful to look at. I would comment on the quality of the video reproduction, but none of the four video podcasts I tried to play showed up on screen -- audio yes, video no, and although I have 10 movies stored on my iPhone at the moment, this dock couldn't locate any of them (I question whether this dock is fully compatible with iOS 5). I could have tried showing photos on screen, but to get to the photo display, you have to manipulate the iPhone yourself via the touchscreen, which kind of defeats the purpose of having a remote.<br /><br />Music playback was fine. It would have been nice if the Nyrius showed album art on screen, but it doesn't.<br /><br />I know using a cable is still a step or two below wireless playback with AirPlay and/or an Apple TV. But until I get there, I will stick with my HDMI cable. It works a lot better for me than this product did."
5,"Great movie.  Loved it.  what brave people they were.  Since the story is true, I looked up the real people."
5,Perfect size for putting in a pocket on my lunchbox.  Great sound with excellent bass.  I use to have a magnavox about the same size that used 3 triple a's and had to be plugged into the phone.  Had almost the same sound quality of this speaker when it had a fresh set of batteries.  An hour later you had to turn down the volume due to bass distortion.  It's nice not having to sacrifice sound quality due to dead batteries with this speaker.
5,"These are the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn.<br />They sound great, plenty of bass even driven from a stock PC 3.5mm jack.<br />Add a DAC and an amp and you're in heaven."
4,"This product doesnt sit as well as original, but for the price (abt $3.00)it was worth it. I got two, one for home and one for work!!!!"
5,Excellent sound reproduction - clear highs and deep bass - well worth the price - highly recommended - small size BIG sound
5,This stand is large and has plenty of room for your monitor and more. It's very sturdy and supports pretty much any size monitor all while being aesthetically pleasing.
4,"While I won't proclaim to be an audiophile, I do know good sounding speaker(s) when I hear them. This speaker is great for a bedroom or a small room where larger speakers just wouldn't be convenient.<br /><br />If there were a 'con' I'd say that the bass level wasn't the best. With that being said, most wireless Bluetooth speakers have horrible bass, so it comes with the territory. However, this speaker offers up the best bass I've heard from such a device, it's just that it isn't a lot."
5,I've used this charger for about a month now and it's perfect! Works perfect and is a GREAT price. This is my 3rd charger I've needed for my laptop (I'm a little rough of my electronics). The previous 2 were brand name Toshiba chargers and this is the first off brand I've purchased and I'll say it's definitely holding up!<br />Very pleased and would most definitely purchase again.
4,"Works great, i used it on my OTA HD card on my computer.  It made the 4 channels i wanted work when my old antenna wouldn't come in clearly and added 2 channels i didn't even know that i could get."
5,"Worked great in Europe, compact for travel, great price fast service."
5,"Works well, use it for Home Theater and 3 Philips Hue lights"
1,"Based on the number of positive reviews, my experience may be somewhat of an outlier. I purchased the BTS via the Kickstarter campaign and received the unit in July. The unit arrived undamaged and partially charged. After getting it paired with my iPhone, I played some music off Pandora and noticed that the sound was distorted. Additionally, when the battery went low the speaker's voice began giving me the &#34;charge me&#34; indication. I plugged the unit in and, after being plugged in for quite some time, the &#34;charge me&#34; indication continued. Eventually, the battery died, while plugged in. I contacted Outdoor Tech and they sent me another charging cable/transformer. The new cable cured the charging problem. However, the biggest problem was the issue of the terribly distorted audio quality. The distortion manifests itself in a high(er) frequency buzzing/rattling sound as music is being played. I'm assuming that the speaker driver is either loose or defective or there is an issue with the enclosure. I appreciate high quality sound and happen to notice poor audio quality quite easily, my wife does not and yet she commented on the poor audio quality. I contacted Outdoor Tech again and they sent me a return authorization form. Due to my frustration with the unit (and the serious let down after FINALLY receiving the unit) I put it in a drawer and never sent it back. I just sent an email to Outdoor Tech to see if they will still rectify the situation and will update this review once I see how they will handle it. It is somewhat frustrating when a mail/web order item is defective considering the pain and inconvenience it is to deal with the RMA system and then, again, WAIT for a unit that hopefully does what it is advertised to do."
4,"The remote arrived without any instructions.  You need to press each button and figure out for yourself its fucntion, it's a PITA but the remote itself works great even from a distance of over 20 feet.  Installation was quick and easy, just plug into USB and it works."
5,"Generally regarded as the best media available, it certainly has lived up to expectations..no coasters, smooth burns and looking forward to long life data and video integrity. Buy with confidence, this media is well worth the 20-30% premium over cheaper, lower quality media. The top side is printable (we use Memorex 300-pack labels instead) and the bottom side dye color is on the dark side, which is good (not as dark as BD-25 blanks, but that is to be expected). The clear, plastic center-portion is blank, which is awesome and classy..never did like seeing brand names or media type printed there."
1,Break too fast I bought two and both break too fast obviously are made with cheap parts
5,Good quality sound.. perfect for practice on my room with my piano and sequence with out making to much noise. Good delivery time
3,Radio is clear and has good selectivity for which we are pleased.  The wall wart power supply is noisy and for a bedroom radio is louder then we would like.
4,Nice quality for a 15 bucks headphones. Nice bass. I am very happy with it. Very much better than smalls headphones.. Amazing sound!
4,To give an item 5 stars it has to be perfect. This product is as close to that as possible. The sound and ease of use are second to none. The price mark is just right.
5,"We got this because our farm truck's (a ford f250hd) CD player went south. Since then, we've used it without fail. The Walkman has bounced off the front seat numerous times as the two of us are listening to e-Books, and never skipped a syllable! We're able to resume from where we left off by virtue of the fact we just don't remove the CD until we're ready to start listening again. I'm guessing there's a flash-mem which retains the current track position. Nonetheless, the Walkman is built sturdy and works well. And when we switch to the town car, we're still able to keep following the latest e-Book we have, right from where we let off. We love it!"
5,Very surprised at the quality of the item.  Sound is good and pairing is very easy.  Only real issue is the cord could be a little longer but that is a very minor issue
5,"I've always been a Sennheiser fan but I also own about 20 different earbuds/headsets across 10 different brands. The quest for the perfect earbuds for running has ended. At the same time, the quests for the perfect earbuds for the plane, at work, and just about anything else have also ended. These MEElectronics M6 earbuds are amazing! After listening to them, I would pay $100 if that was the going price.<br /><br />PROS<br />- Fits perfectly out of the box (six pairs of ear pieces to ensure find one that you can get a tight seal with)<br />- Very good highs, mids, and lows -- if you can't hear/feel the bass, then try a different ear piece to get that seal<br />- Amazingly comfortable even though this is deep in my ear canal<br />- Does not move at all during running; I can turn my head, do jumping jacks, etc... they stay in place<br />- Isolates from other noises -- no active noise cancelling but it will block noise, including your own voice when you speak<br />- Cord management is well thought-out; not only does it have a clip but it also has tightener where the left/right wires come together<br /><br />CONS<br />- Since a tight seal is necessary, I can hear the sound of the cords rubbing against my body when I'm running; in order to minimize that, I need to hang the cord in the front and not the back<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I really wish I bought these sooner. I'm glad I found a set of earbuds that are no longer 'just good enough' but actually motivates me to put them on and go for a run! The best $20 I've ever spent."
5,I connected my pc to the TV with this and it works great.
3,"They are made well and work fine.  Way overpriced for what they are.  They should have come with the speakers, the speakers were expensive enough."
5,I use my phone like an iPod and this is the perfect connector for that.  It also works on my iPod the same way.
4,Charges just fine. Blinking light goes out to let you know it's done.
5,I was looking for a decent pair of earphones to listen to things online while the rest of the family was watching TV.  What I got was some really high quality phones for a great price.
5,cable worked as expected and fit perfectly. I was worried because this was for a small flat TV that I lost the power plug for. So I'm really happy it fit and works.
4,"These work very well.  I bought these to replace a sony set that I'd had for over 2 years and am pleasantly surprised.  The headset is light and the ear peices fit over my ears very comfortably, not touching my ears at all.  The sound is better than my old Sony headset, which is nice, although I had no issues with the Sony.  It does require a separate receiver, which isn't cheap.  That was an unpleasant shock.  But, now that everything is here, hooked up and working, I have nothing bad to say about either the headset or receiver."
5,"I have been using this mouse pad with multiple mouses and I find between my lower end DPI mouse and my 5600DPI mouse it works just as good for both! I really liked how it comes with a hard case, and that makes it easy for me to bring to college everyday with me. I really like how it doesn't slide when in use. This is a great mouse pad and paying the extra $20 to get this than a cheap one is defiantly worth it because it works so much better for when I am PC Gaming."
5,"Usually I only spend 5 bucks for headphones, and they wind up going out after a couple of weeks. Those headphones were never the greatest quality to begin with. The philips in-ear headphones I purchased made me rethink headphones, they are amazing with crisp loud sound! I will definitely purchase these when my current ones go bad."
5,What can I say? I've not done a detailed specification test in a lab. I have used the cable with my laptop and HDTV and everything was fine. The cable did sadden a friend of mine when I told him I bought it for under $10. He paid over $100 for a different brand with the same specifications.
4,The display screen is clear and easy to see.  The projected time on the ceiling is large and clear enough for me to see without my glasses.  That's a very convenient thing for me.  My only complaint is that the setup is a little obscure.  Don't throw away the directions.
5,I needed an HDMI cord for my new media center computer(built with a [[ASIN:B009SQQF9C Raspberry Pi Model B Revision 2.0 (512MB)]]) and since all HDMI cables are the same quality I went for the cheapest one I could find. You can't beat $1.63 with free shipping. I've been using it for a few months now with no problems.
3,"I love how the sound of these headphones make, i also loved how they feel in my ears, i have bought a few beacause  for some unknow reason one of the head phones is  always breaking very easily."
2,"The hold switch fell off at first use. The buttons on top are not labeled, no arrows, squares, etc. At least it works, I guess."
5,Love these headphones..
5,Everything I expected.  It takes up so little space.  The previous item I had was very space consuming.Thank you very much..
5,"Works perfect, arrived fast and customer service was excellent.  Very happy with this purchase. Now I can play my iTunes from my 5S over my 4 sound dock"
5,"Had my KOSS UR-20 'phones for over FIVE YEARS now, and they still work great! Which is rare for electronic items, especially priced under $30. Definitely a quality item."
1,Was wonderful.... Unfortunately it just stopped working one day only two months after purchase. It was only used 3x a week at work for only a couple hours at a time.
4,"I purchased this device to replace three remotes and most importantly the remote provided for the DVR by my cable provider.  The remote for the DVR also controls the TV and thus is the primary remote.  However, its keys are difficult to push and my thumb was starting to get sore with use.  I chose this remote because reviewers indicated it was reliable, sturdy and flexible.      I agree that this remote is sturdy.  You drop it and it keeps on working.  The keys are easy to push with my thumb or fingers and minimal resistance.  The side keys are a little small and not as convenient as the larger keys that control most of the functions.  The side keys control up/dn for volume and channels, and certain functions of playback.  They are OK once you adapt to the remote.    The instructions are minimal in the print form but they are provided as a type of help function when you program the remote. It took me about 30 minutes to read the instructions and learn the basic programming method.  My wife would never have figured it out.  You need some technological sense to program it.  Once you figure it out, then it becomes fairly easy to do.  I was able to program it easily for my DVR (cable) and TV. The DVR box was Magnavox and the TV Panasonic.  My DVD player is Panasonic would not accept a code number so I had to program it button by button.  That is not fun and it is not as flexible.  I programmed it to turn on the DVD but then I use the controls of the DVD to play, etc, as the button by button controls are not as flexible or intuitive.  If all the devices had been  programmed by using a code number I would have given it a 5 star. Even though I was not able to program the DVD I give it a 4 star because it is reliable and controls properly the DVR and TV, which I mostly used.  If someone is challenged by technology I would not recommend it unless you have someone in the house who could set it up for you or trouble shoot it."
5,"A little pricier than other chargers, but well worth it. the combo of this charger and the eneloop batteries is absolutely the way to go."
2,"I think the relatively high price for these requires the product be a premium product.  Unfortunately it is not.  Although the sound quality is great (really), and the tubes are the longest I've seen (best EMF exposure reduction from user), and the comfort is fantastic (triple-flanged rubber ear-inserts)...the sad part is that it malfunctioned only a few weeks after pruchase, and I hardly used it all (maybe 50 times).  Currently I can hear the other person, but they can't hear me.  Probably a break in one of the wires somewhere.  Also: one of the triple-flanged ear inserts split and now doesn't attach anymore.  I can't figure out how to contact the seller as Amazon says it's no longer eligible for a return.<br /><br />P.S. I also bought the \\""Natural Health Alternatives Black Hollow Air Tube Anti-Radiation Headset Stereo Model Emf Protector\\"" at the exact same time as a backup (thankfully) and it works well.  It also has good sound-quality (almost as good as Smart&Safe), but is only half as comfortable, and the tubes aren't as long (less EMF reduction to user).  Oddly, it's unfortunately REALLY loud, such that phone calls actually hurt my ears, even with the phone volume turned ALL the way down.  I don't remember having this excessive volume problem with the Smart&Safe.  I recall that the volume was just right.<br /><br />If they can improve the quality on the Smart&Safe, it would be nearly perfect (needs its own volume control though).  Unfortunately, it's way overpriced for something that only lasts a few weeks."
5,"My setup is relatively simple.  I have a media center pc that I use for both my regular TV and my theater room.  The media center (Windows 7) had problems when I would switch from my TV to my projector.  It was really frustrating because of course it happened most when I had guests over.  Just switching the device from TV to project or back would frequently cause the media center to blue screen and die.  Since I've installed this device I have had absolutely no problems with the media center.  It always works when I need it do.  I believe that the product is a little over priced at around $100, but it does work."
3,They are just standard extension cables for headphones. They perform that job well without adding any appearant extra noise or artifacts.
3,Had some trouble setting up as directions are limited. Shipped from China so box was a little damaged but product was intact.
4,"Huge space that can hold videos, pictures and songs.  Highly recommend but the screen is a bit small."
5,good
5,"Bought for bedroom without window-area, seems to bring in<br />most channels from afar. Perfect for apt-dwelling, or student dorms with no hassle."
1,"The adhesive is on the flap an not on the back of the bag.  When you pull out the material, the adhesive sticks to the item you are trying to preserve.  This is liable to ruin the valuable photo or paper object you want to preserve!<br />The other brands are fine.  I have been using them for years.  Why the suddenly changed to this is beyond me."
2,"Sound quality for calls is good, but sound quality for music is not. Music sounds flat, and bass is very limited. The flat cable design is nice because it helps reduce tangling, but I wouldn't say it's &#34;tangle free.&#34; I have had my pair for about 6 months without them breaking, but I only use them for calls in my office so I can't speak to their durability with day to day usage.<br /><br />Beware the highest ranked reviews of this product - none are verified purchases, and almost all of them are accounts that only rate MQbix products. Admittedly, this is not a verified review, but the attached picture should show that I do have these."
5,"I wear these everyday riding my bike to work(fast).  Love these!  Sound gread and they stay put.  I always have problems wearing anything on my ears falling off or hurting after a while.  After 6 months of everyday use, you'd have to pry these from my cold dead fingers!"
5,"When i seen this deal, I had to get it and it's legit too! All the DVD's are in good condition and I had no problems with them.  And all for the cheapest price!"
2,The way to attach to a wall would not hold up very long when unplugging cords. Screws needed are too small.
4,Possible interference to each individual wiring run is always a crapshoot but I didn't hit any and this sounds great feeding and old audio receiver on my sun porch for those speakers and some outdoor speakers. Would highly recommend for the price (or you can opt for a shielded cable &#62;$100).
5,"Just mount this on the wall, and all the chaos of cables will be tamed.<br />Form meets function, enough said"
5,Love this stereo- it has awesome sound!
5,This is the fourth stack of 100 i have ordered only one coaster out of the bunch.  great product and great price I suggest if you do dvd covers this is the product to get it works so well with my epson artison 837 printer. and Burns with no problems
5,"Like the title says, I'm concurrently on my third pair. The first pair (purchased in late 2009) had a design defect in the headphonejack that broke the wires on the inside after about a years worth of use. A short email later I got a RMA number, returned the old broken pair and within about 2 weeks was sent what I'm assuming were a refurbished pair that had a redesigned headphone jack. These in turn worked great for a few months until they too stopped working. These also had a problem with the headphone jack, this time a material defect. A bit of exposed wire in the jack caused the sound to cut in and out. A short email later I was given another RMA number and sent a pair of BRAND new buds. So with all of tht in mind, how can I give these buds a five star rating?...  Well tbw, they sound incredible! These are some seriously nice earbuds. The mids sound great, and unlike most contemporary buds the bass won't drown everything else out (not that there's anything wrong with the bass on these btw). These are some incredibly well balanced buds. They also drown out most ambient sound when in. I love the matte finish, and their inconspicuous design! They also come with a handy clip you can use to attach them to your shirt so they don't flap around when worn (that I broke after a while that they replaced for FREE!), have an inline mic, and Controls that work with almost any Android phone! As a Android user awash in a sea full of iOnly compatible accessories I can't tell you how refreshing it is to have accessory that's fully compatible with my phone of choice!  So, in addition to some awesome sounding and looking buds (as evidenced by the countless other reviews I'm sure), the real killer feature that sets these these buds apart from any other in the same price range is the company that stands behind them. What other company would go to the lengths they did to honor their product like they did almost two years after my initial purchase? Not many I'm guessing, and that's whywhenever I need a new pair sometime in the future they'll be Etymotics."
5,great stuff
5,"Deluxe headphones. Material that I thought I was familiar with has sounds that I never knew were there. Things in the background and depth of instruments and voices I have never heard before. I must listen to everything in the house with new ears.I expected that these headphones would be good, they are my third pair of Beyerdynamics,not including an wonderful pair of ear buds thrown in but these caught me by surprise. The sound is brilliant. And they are amazingly comfortable, it is like having nothing on but the music.I am very pleased and delighted that I purchased the T 51p's. They were slightly out of my price range but the over the top experience of hearing such wondrous  sound is a real treat."
5,I used these to move the computer to the other side of the room and still be able to hook it to the TV. They work great! Quite a bargain!
3,Very comfortable but the ear pad comes apart in in a few months. Not made to last.
1,DON'T GET RIPPED OFF THEW WAY THAT I DID!<br /><br />The 1200AVR requires a match PAIR of batteries. So do not buy this!
5,Fit perfectly to my pioneer hdj 2000. It was really easy to put them on. You wont see much difference. The only con is that its just a little bit less confortable than the original ones but for $10 its a really good product. Noboday want to pay 40 to 50 for the original ones the headphones cost enough already!
3,Easy to install...picture is OK.
5,I gave as a gift.  The sound is out of this world for such a small speaker.  Would buy again
4,I only wish they produced a model that had a number pad so my mother could key in the channel she wanted to watch.
3,"I tried these 3d compat. glasses and couldnt get used to the intermittent Rt. to Lt. flickering of lenses if rf signal became weak,  They do block side glare better than my samsung 4100 3d glasses. The case included is very protective.  I returned these the next day"
5,"Attached a Zune played to this speaker and was impresed- to say the least - by the sound quality of this speaker. Stereo sound separation is excellent as is tonal quality; room filling, undistorted misic is the norm with this speaker. As a bonus, this speaker can be attached to other<br />components( even a T/V )with the included cables to enhance one's listening/viewing experence. The unit's uses are only limited by the user's imagation."

1,"My last Sony system was defective. I sent it back and it took 20 days for them to tell me that they received it &#34;damaged&#34;. It has now been more than a month and I so not have pictures of the damage OR the device back. I am finished with Sony products. If you have no issues, good for you. But if you need to rely on warranty repair, good luck. You just flushed your money down the toilet. Your choice, but I would avoid Sony like the plague. They are hurting from the failed wireless business and all of your support is coming from an inept India support team. You've been warned."
5,"I've had a pair in my workshop for a couple months now, and am very satisfied. For the price, their sound quality is very good. For my ear, and average listening level, I've boosted up the high and low ranges on the amplifier a bit (they are a little mid-range heavy; but that's not too surprising for a setup of this conformation). The housing and overall construction seem substantial. Well worth the price, and I think they're better than some bookshelf/outdoor speakers I've heard which cost more."
5,"So far so good,  inexpensive compared to Sony's lamp.  The tv is old so we thought we would try this instead of replacing the tv."
5,Does just what needs to do!  Will purchase more.  No problems with inserting to or removing from the LP covers. Will purchase more.  It's a great product!
5,"I paired these speakers with the Pioneer VSX-819H-K receiver.  I am very very pleased with the power, sound, and clarity of these speakers.  I have them in a room that is about 20 feet by 20 feet with hardwood floors.  If you have an extremely large room with heavey drapery and carpet, you may want something more powerful.  But, I think you'll be amazed at the sound these little speakers push out."
4,"This remote has a nice design and I was pleased that I didn't have to program it. I simply put in the batteries and all features worked with my Sony Bravia LCD.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the input source and muting buttons are black rather than white which makes them a bit difficult to read. All off the other common buttons (numbers, volume, channel, power) are easy to read."
3,"It was a good deal, but the cord was only 4 feet long! Really now. I'm supposed to sit that close to a 52\\"" tv just to play my PSP on it? All it needed was a little modding, though. Splice a few wires and you're good to go. I found that a PS2 Guitar Hero guitar has a perfect wire to do this. If you get this, either you should have a 10\\"" screen (but then, why bother, right?), or be prepared to do some work!"
5,"it's Very useful, i recommend it."
4,"They are great for traveling! Light weight, sounds great, small enough to packed in on carrier on bag, and the ear pads can be replaceable in time along the headphones jack."
4,"The remote came in on time, but tends to stop working. Essentially I bang it with my hand to hopefully get it working again"
5,This saved the day for me. A very easy and simple for USB 3.0 connections.
5,"Wiring pins were in the wrong pin location on the plug for my projector. Easily moved the pins, everything works perfectly!! Great price! Will buy again and again..."
5,"This is the 2nd pair of TuneBuds I have purchased for an iPod and I love these earbuds. I have smaller ear canals and you can choose the size bud you need to fit the ear canal. They fit perfectly and stay in my ears. The quality of sound is terrific and you don't need to turn the volume up until you lose your hearing to get good quality from these earbuds.  You will not be disappointed with these and I got the colors I needed to match my iPod shuffle (green) and a red case for my iPod touch. I tried other brands, even what came with the iPods and I like TuneBuds the best."
5,works perfectly as advertise
5,"I have tried many products to control the volume on external speakers off my Bose acoustic wave radio, and none of them worked.I took a gamble for under 10 bucks and bought this item.It works perfect for what I wanted to do.Bose has a STUPID set up to install external speaker to their radio. The headphone jack has to be turned to output the speakers come on and the radio stays on. To shut the radio off you turn the volume on the radio off and the speakers stayed on. there was no control of the speakers, that were to loud for me. I pluged the device into the headphone jack did all of the above , plug the speakers into it and use it to lower the volume.I wish the range of control was greater but it works for me. I am ordering another as a spare"
5,"We've had a pair of these headphones going on two years now and they still perform like new!  We use them in everything from the mp3 player, laptop, portable DVD player, Leapster, etc.<br /><br />The volume is automatically lowered for kids safety, and the ears of the headset are well padded to protect your little one.  These are basic kid-sized headphones at a great price.  While they may not be really compact, flashy, or have additional features like other headsets out there, THIS pair will definitely not disappoint!"
1,"I purchased this integrated amplifier/DAC in May 2014 to use with a Logitech Touch (squeezebox streamer) and PSB Imagine T2 Tower. I like it a lot, but right now it's on its way back to Peachtree to fix a failed pot in the volume control that was making noise. So apparently some design or quality issues, not at all what you'd expect at this price point. And the return via FedEx GROUND is a nice touch Peachtree.    UPDATE: Eventually the amplifier arrived. The volume knob no longer makes noise, but there's intermittent static-y noise, even without a source connected, which was not there before.  I'm returning it."
1,My son was able to use a bobby pin to open the box.  I was not very happy after spending the amount of money I did.
5,These cases might be tricky to get on at first but once you get them on they are easy to take on and off again! I change colors all the time
1,"Tried establishing a signal from my Wii to my computer monitor.  It did not work.  My monitor acts like it's receiving an intermittent signal, but the video is black(I used 2 different component cables by the way).  I also bought an XCM VGA box, and ended up with the exact same effect.  The Wii simply would not work with my monitor.  I also tried hooking it up to another monitor.  No such luck.  I used a WDTV Live Plus, on the device to make sure it was working.  It appeared to accept that signal, but would not accept the Wii's signal.  I am familiar with the required settings for the Wii.  E.g. 480P.  It was not ignorance that kept me from achieving the goal. I may never know though.  I plan to buy a Dell monitor that has integrated Component inputs :D I can't give it more than one star, because it's supposed to work with the Wii, yet it does not. I tried everything...There's nothing wrong with my Wii."
3,"software is not supported by windows xp, and the instructions included were printed in chinese which made it impossible to configure"
4,Delivered quickly. Good quality.
5,Excellent product
5,"Switched to being an old-internet household, and this has helped the transition. Living just outside of a metropolitan area, we get plenty of channels, and I won't have to pay for alternate services in order to watch my beloved Football games in HD."
2,"I bought these for my mechanical mod and was disappointed in the performance. I noticed major performance drop as soon as the batteries hit 3.9 volts. I would not buy these again! If you are on the fence between the sony 2500 v5, get the sony's."
5,Seems fine so far. nice unit
5,Does a great job with good sound quality for hikes and running.  I like this style (over the head) versus the earbud style since it stays on much better especially with big jolts when hiking down hill and/or over rough terrain.
2,"I did not like this product at all, as it worked only for few months and the cord was very short, but I ordered it again, for the price I pay It's not bad at all."
1,worked for two months now its broke and amazon wont exchange it. pricey mistake
5,good job and solved my problem
2,"This package is advertised as music-to-go, but the carrying case is not large enough to house the extra batttery?  Bose sound quality is excellent, but we purchased this to be portable."
5,One of our plumbers had this in the garage when he was working on our water heater and it worked so good I decided to try one and they are just perfect for my phone and sound great.
3,"UB 20 does not fit for HTS-520 system, we have to buy UB-50. Prices are too high for a wall bracket. :-("
5,"What can you say?  When you have a high output flashlight you need to replace the batteries often.  For my job, daily.  This set is perfect!  I was never much for rechargeable batteries but I have definately been swayed."
3,"The sound on these doesn't blow me away but is fine for outdoor patio use.  They can get plenty loud and the price was definitely a good deal.  I only really have had two issues thus far.      First of all, if you plan on mounting these any way but straight off a wall, plan on purchasing additional mounting hardware.  The instructions mention some sort of 'mega' bracket, which is a joke.  I scoured the net and found others baffled by this phantom mounting device.  Yamaha is doing a disservice to it's customers by even printing this in the enclosed documentation.  I needed to mount these on the patio ceiling but did end up finding a great bracket that is sturdy and has quite a bit of flexibility.  The bracket is item number 10776 from a1components.com.  I'm sure you can find it elsewhere but it is very sturdy, made of metal and not plastic.  Best of all it was only $13 per bracket.  It did the trick for ceiling mounting.    The other issue is the grills just fall off.  After only about two weeks outside, the grills just dropped right off.  I live in Texas but the speakers are completely out of the sun.  I had to strap rubber bands around the speaker bodies to keep the grills on.  It's not attractive but seems to work.  It seems like a better design would include a simple clip in of the grills instead of using glue.  The Yamaha engineers must not have tested the glue above 80 degrees F."
5,Excellent
5,Works great with the wall mount speakers I bought. This item came double boxed and was shipped out very quickly. Very happy with this one.
5,"Overall Impression<br /><br />I just picked one of these up based on the reviews on Amazon as well as a few reviews on here. And while I is a dual purpose integrated hybrid/tube amp and headphone amp, this amp really earns its money as the integrated amp. It does the headphone thing pretty good, but I have to be honest.  I can not say that it is better than a properly configured Asus STX's headphone out, but its only marginally more expensive than the soundcard. But, I do not think I would be doing this thing justice without talking about its speaker driving abilities as an integrated amp. As an amplifier, most will rule it out due to its limited specs of 16.5 watts @ 8 ohms.Well, I have to say this things sounds better than two of my $800 Integrateds (NAD and Sony ES).  If you have somewhat efficient speakers and not trying to fill a large room, this thing will drive speakers to loud but enjoyable volumes with ease. This is perfect for an office or bedroom. This thing has a tremendous soundstage and plenty of low end grunt, without sounding bloated for exaggerated, even through bookshelf speakers,  Even with a flat eq setting on the STX, it sound full an balanced with the right amount of glassy sparkle with a touch of midrange complexity.<br /><br />Tubes<br /><br />These take 6N3 or equivalents.  As for tube rolling, I feel a lot of people get caught up into it so much that they hear things based more on expectations than reality.  Judging tubes is one thing that I feel I am more experienced in than a lot of people, as I've not only been using them for 30 years, I've also done a lot of tube amp repair work, as well as some building and modification for professional musicians. Although most of my experience is on the guitar amp side, I can assure you that guitarists are just as picky as audiophiles.  I started out with the stock Chinese tubes, which appear to be Shuguang.  I also bout about 4 sets of GE 5670W's. The thing people miss about tubes is that the tolerance for any manufacturer is all over the map.  The output on one tube from the same maker can be up to 30% from the next tube of the line. If you have a tested or a reliable vendor that measures and tests tubes, I contend that a cheap tube that is strong and within spec with sound nearly as good as the expensive tube within the same specs. No guarantee just because its more expensive it will sound better. The other point I would like to make is that most designers design around evaluations done with a specific tube. So, they tweak according to what they are hearing with a specific tube. In my case I think the stock tube sounds better than the GE tubes. The GE tubes sound as if they have more gain, resulting in a little more boomy sound, but the stock tubes sound more natural to me. Both tubes have pretty small plates and seem quiet and free from microphonics.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />I highly recommend this amp for a study or bedrooms.  It's simple looks cool and sounds like an amp 3 times its price.  I promise you that you will be surprised the sound that comes from this thing.  As for the headphone amp, I think this may be overkill for just that. I rate is a very good, but not OMG good.<br /><br />FLAC -> Asus STX -> Qinpu A-6000 Mk2 -> Kimber 4VS Kables -> Dali Lektor 3 speakers"
3,this remote was not what I order. looks nothing  like the one on-line. It works fine and I will not send it back just to much trouble.
5,everything worked just fine and came on time. they are just what I needed to complete my setup. We use them to patch cell phones into a sound system or for attaching video equipment to portable video set ups.
4,"I have had these headphones for over a year after I tried out about 2 other pairs from different brands, both of which either sounded muddy or tinny. These headphones have clear sound and satisfying bass, for the price you really cant complain. I paid almost $30 for these at Circuit City and I would do it again. I take them with me everywhere and use them with my laptop, DS and portable DVD player. I listen to all sorts of music, everything from metal to dubstep and I dont have any complaints with how these deliver the sound. For sure they are the best in this price range, period. My only complaint is they do get uncomfortable, I wear them for hours on end occasionally (gaming or listening to tons of music) and when I take them off my ears really ache and are kinda numb. They lack good cushioning. Also, as some of the other reviews have mentioned, they do tend to move around a bit on your ears and can affect the sound but just a quick reajustment and they are back in full. I would recommend these headphones to anyone that casually listenens to music or just wants to watch some Youtube vids. If your gonna be wearing them for more than an hour or so then you will need to give your ears a break for a few minutes every now and then. The bottom line: for the price you cant beat them, love the sound, they are tough, look good and as long as you give your ears a rest occasionally they will be fine."
4,Great little speaker. Its nice and loud and I gave it 4 only because it vibrates on louder settings making it kind of distorted. I still love it and use it all the time.
5,"These are simple 2-way design with a 4&#34; midrange and 1&#34; soft some tweeter. These are a great example of what can happen when you take two modest components and execute the design with well chosen crossover points and enclosure design. You get a great sounding speaker with a surprising response in the low end, warm, detailed midrange and a clean upper register that after 4hrs did not produce a hint of fatigue that often plague the listener with lower end speakers. I was convinced that I would need to turn on the powered sub to round out the sound stage, but to my surprise this wasn't absolutely necessary with jazz, acoustic rock and blues. I'm not saying these speakers will produce tons of bass, but their well designed ported enclosure allows a much fuller low to midrange transition than a lot fo speakers I've demo'd that, despite significantly higher cost, are lost without the help of a subwoofer. So it's IMHO, that I would say these are the best bookshelf speakers I have heard in the sub $50 category. I've seen them at local big big stores with their &#34;promo codes&#34; in the sub $40 region and for that they are an absolute steal."
5,Got it for my son and he was happy with it.Shipping was faster than what they said.
2,"I DID NOT RECEIVE IT.  ,,,,,,,!!?????<br /><br />The radio was only giving fm  and that's great but mouthing else<br /> Fm is terrific"
5,I did the shopping for you.<br />The Tripp Lite TLP810NET  Surge protector simply stated is of great quality and took the mess behind my computer of wires from everywhere and put them in their place.<br />Not much else to say other than the price was excellent and the service as always from Amazon is great. It is doing its job and i have not thought about it since i installed it.<br />I actually purchased it when i added a subwoofer to my current computer setup.<br />I would highly recommend this product. Tripp Lite is quality.
5,had the same problem as the guy above me.. tv made clicking noise...       replacing this board fixed my tv like brand new again..      thank you so much amazon.com   saved me so much $$$$$
5,Great deal and quick shipment.
2,"Bought these headphones with low expecatations knowing the sound wouldn't be all that great, but they are really flat.  Maxell quality is usually pretty good, but they missed the bar with these."
1,"Worked great for about six months. The OEM bulb we had in first lasted for four years, so there's definitely a difference in quality. Would not recommend."
5,Great sound especially for the price of $19.95.  Planning to take it to the beach in Hawaii next week for vacation.
5,"One of the selling features of the Audio-Technica (AT) headphone series is that the ear pads are replaceable.  I suspect there are many users that considered that a &#34;nice-to-have&#34; feature, but not something they would ever cash in on.  This particular set of headphones advertised flat response (fs).  Accordingly they replaced a more expensive set of DJ headphones I had been using for pleasure listening since DJ headphones usually emphasize the bass.  With the flat response of these ATH-M40fs, I have been able to use them for rough mixes.  So much so, that (even with an acoustically imperfect room), I have figured out how to mix with these--and then afterward have developed a consistent tweak of the EQ for the masters.  These headphones allow one to do rough to nearly final mixes (final mix with studio speakers, of course).  Consequently, after considerable studio hours, the material covering the earpads started to disintegrate.  How great not to have to replace the whole shootin' match when the headphones themselves are still kickin'!  This set of headphones (and the replaceable earpads) are definitely one of my best studio purchases!"
5,I ordered one and liked it well enough I ordered another.
5,"This was a gift for my daughter and it was a big hit. She loves all the features, especially the video mode. So glad we upgraded and bought the 32GB."
1,No improvement at all !!!
1,"Worked for 3 months, not it can't connect to any of my devices. Spend the money on a better unit."
3,I purchased these just because they were the newest model and I own the other Bose headphones. The packaging is a big turn off when you are looking forward to playing with your newest toy. You have to stop to go find a scissors to cut open the package.  The cord on these are to long for my taste and the sound is muddy. For $30 more you can get the OE's with a better carry case and sound quality. The OE's are also a smaller size headset which is great.
3,The speaker works well except it has no volume control. I like to turn the sound down when commercials come on which happens alot when you listen to talk radio.
5,Arrived fast and perfect thank you
5,They stay in the ear exactly where you put them even after a 45 minute run.  They sound great - not a full rich sound like studio earphones - but who would expect that?  They have plenty of volume unlike similarly shaped Sony headphones I have.  And the price is exceptional for what they are.  I'm buying more for backups.  Highly recommend!
2,"If you need a HDMI cable that is quick, avoid these. 2 out my 4 HDMI inputs would not function with them. The units seem to need a cable with higher speed capabilities. It's my fault though. I didn't research the HDMI cables enough to know that different cables offer different speeds. They did not work with my AppleTV or my cable box. They seem to do okay with my BluRay and HD video players however.    On a positive note, I notified the seller that I wasn't happy with the cables and they offered to take them back. After finding that they worked with certain units, I went ahead and kept them."
4,I bought these as a gift for my niece who is a Hello Kitty fan.  She liked the &#34;bling&#34; of these earbuds.  Great for any age fan of the Hello Kitty design.
1,Not suitable for use on a TV since the lag or latency is too great and will not sinc with the TV image.
4,"I'm happy with them so far. Very nice sound quality. Pretty comfortable, though ears begin to feel cramped after long stretches of use."
5,"Yup, I bought these with my new Samsung 720P HD LED TV. I wasn't disappointed. No cables came with the TV, that's the NEW NORMAL, get used to it, and buy what you know you will need. Right from my PC Video card to my TV/Monitor. Awesome!"
5,"Nice, very good..."
5,"I purchased this cable to run from my [[ASIN:B0013ZGOWY Yamaha RX-V663BL 665 Watt 7.1-Channel Home Theater Receiver]] to my [[ASIN:B0014175NE Samsung LN40A650 40-inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV with RED Touch of Color]].  I plugged it in, and I have had no problems.  My HD signals are transmitted to my television, and I see beautiful HD images.  Also, the cable looks and feels like a high-quality product right out of the box.  The only people who will tell you that you need to buy Monster Cable are salespeople at the big-box retailers, and people who have already bought Monster Cable and want to save face when you tell them you purchased your cable for under $20.00."
5,"When I needed to order another cable to set up my Roku with my BOSE sound system and TV, I noticed that this seems to be a new type. So I ordered it. WOW what a difference it made in the quality over the Blue Rigger HDMI cables I ordered a couple of years ago.  I just ordered another like it for a friend who also is setting up Roku with his TV.  Highly recommend this."
3,"Peter B. Degroot review \\""Good sound for the money with some limitations\\"" form November 20, 2008 best summarizes performance of this product."
5,We bought this for our 6 year olds ipod shuffle....We have it charging through the usb in her wii. I like the fact it glows blue when charging so she knows when it is charging or not.
5,"My husband bought this as he needed more HDMI outlets.  I think it didn't help with the remote control situation, so as a woman I think it is nuts.  But the actual product is wonderful and the service was, too!  Everything is working like a charm and he is happy with it.  I have to admit the lights glow like a landing UFO, but a simple cover at night takes care of the &#34;glow.&#34;"
1,"Installed this cable, only to find out that it the signal cuts in and out.  I thought my cable TV service went out, and then I tried a crappy $4 HDMI cable and sure enough, it worked.  Very disappointed."
5,"I was provided with a free copy of this item for testing and my fair and honest evaluation.  Of course receiving something for free may impact any review, but I can honestly say this is a solid product and worth the cost listed here.  I have delayed my review a bit simply because I wanted to see if I would actually use and benefit from this Speaker.  It has served its purpose on several occasions.  I have used it in my office both as a charger and speaker.  Packaging -  shipped in solid packaging that was padded well, there is no way this should be damaged in shipping.  Comes with the charging cable and a cloth bag for carrying and keeping from dust.  Ease of setup - Charged it for the recommended time of two hours and easily got 8-10 hours of use before recharging.  Powered up and started the pairing process, which connected without a hitch on the first try.  Have not had any issues connecting via bluetooth at any point.  I have not figured out the NFC option, but I am confident that is user error, and not really necessary.  Buttons/Features - Has power, phone, play/pause, and volume or track buttons.  I will say that everything works as advertised, but remembering the button combination to make things work takes a little bit of a learning curve.  It is as simple as pressing or long pressing combinations, but if I had a complaint, I wish that I didnt have to think before pressing, but not a deal breaker.  I like the ability to answer my phone while listening to music.  This comes in handy when at the office and having hands free talking that seems to be clear enough.  The sound through the speaker for calls is plenty clear, and nobody has complained when I have used this method to talk with them.  Sound Quality - This is not a surround sound experience, and sound at maximum volumes isn't as rich as a high dollar audio system.  (I have edited this portion of the review)  The speaker is surprisingly loud, and I have yet to have a need to turn the sound all the way upother than for testing.  All of my testing has been done with an LG G3 phone connected to the speaker, and a Asus Chromebook.  I would rate the sound quality a 4 of 5 considering the size and a 3 - 5 if I was just rating pure sound quality regardless of price.  I think it is important to consider what you are using.  If I wanted a high dollar sound system, I would not be buying this device.  For the market of portable bluetooth speakers I would say the sound quality is very good.  Use as a Power Bank - I think this is probably the feature that has me most interested in buying a second unit.  When at my office, my desk is small and the compact speaker size is great, add the sound from that compact space and the device is solid.  Add to it that I can give my phone a fast charge when needed is a nice bonus.  The manual also claims that you can connect more than one speaker together.  I have a feeling I will be buying a second speaker to keep at home so this one can stay at my office.  I will test this out and edit the review if I do end up buying a second one.  I also will get a video review posted as time allows and after using it for a little longer.  Overall, this is a quality device.  I have bought a few other Sharkk products and so far I have not had any issues with their products.  If you are looking for a speaker that is compact, practical, and provides powerful sound this is a worthy option.  I use in a small office and a large living room and the sound fills the room well."
5,"My daughter loved them!<br />They worked with her i-pod touch, which was what she wanted to use the headphones on!"
5,Don't over pay.  Chet will tell you the budget hdmi work every bit as well as the big buck cables
5,"I've been using my JBuds while riding to work on my bike; it's about an hour-long trip.  They're comfortable, hardly ever fall out, and have better sound quality than the ones that came with my iPod. Would definitely recommend - good value all around."
5,great product. Met expectations. Reasonably fast delivery. Im pleased. The RCA cable met my expectations and I wish I didnt have to submit more words
5,Good
2,"Out of 100 CDs, at least half were defective.  Amazon did issue a refund."
1,These glasses were not compatible with my TV even though they claimed to be.
5,"This Peerless small TV (up to 22 ins) wall mount is probably one of the most versatile and good looking mount on the market.  It is very easy to mount and well built for the size of the TV being mounted.  All knuckles are very tight and no excess movement will be notice once the unit is positioned were it serves the user the best.  The finish is very durable and will last for ever.  Just follow the directions when installing the unit, very important!"
5,"In short, this is a great product. It can be broken down into a compact C shape, it has great quality sound, and the noise canceling works great. It dampens most other sounds, and makes lulls in the background disappear! It is great for studying and isolating oneself into a world of learning or focusing!. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
1,And it wasn't.  Lamp looked used when I opened it and within 10 minutes it burned out.<br />Stay away from this seller!
4,"These mounts are pretty solidly built.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Lots of hardware options to mount just about any speaker<br />Adjustable for just about any angle<br />each mount has an extension to mount from a ceiling<br /><br />Cons<br />No way to run the wire through the mount.  I had to drill a hole next to the mount for the speaker connection.<br /><br />Overall happy.  I know I could have bought a more expensive mount that allows for the speaker to plug into it directly, but I did not want to pay the extra money.  So I strategically drilled the holes so they could not be seen when watching tv.<br /><br />I'd buy again."
5,No problems with these batteries and charger
5,"This AmazonBasics bluetooth speaker works great.  I was a bit skeptical at first, I wasn't aware Amazon was into creating audio products, but I must say I am impressed so far. The speaker itself is small, very portable, and appears pretty sturdy.  I Use this speaker for personal training outdoors, and in a warehouse setting. Set-up was extremely easy and works great right from Pandora on my smartphone.  The speaker gets loud enough for what I need but I Wouldn't recommend it for a very large area.  The clarity is what impressed me the most.  I would have expected this from a 100+ dollar speaker.  The only gripe I have is that it doesn't come with a wall charger.  I'm not deducting a point for that since it charged just fine from my droids micro usb wall charger."
5,"if you are thinking about getting an intro surround system, this is a great beginner-intermediate component to start with. don't waste your money on inferior turn-key systems for $300 to $500, but rather spend a little more--$700 to $1k, and build a GREAT system wich you will enjoy for years. i never knew my speakers were so capable of producing such quality sound. The onkyo is worth the price and is user friendly, only the instructions don't exactly match the actual set up steps. this, however, is not a problem since setup and operation is intuative and easy via the display on the receiver."
4,i like it really cheap for the price i would buy another one next time i get some money next mounth
5,"Initially I was planning to buy ipod shuffle, but when I came across the clip, I decided to give it a try. The sound quality is really good, The voice recording is good at 24000 Hz and is of decent quality, very helpful in recoding speeches. There are one / two very minor bugs though, but doesnt matter, for this price its a good deal, also with the latest firmware upgrade, you can play ogg files as well!"
5,"Works just like I thought it would! Love the adjustable snooze time and multiple alarms. The sound quality is fantastic, very crisp, and can go to a pretty high volume if you want. My old alarm clack was the previous version of this one, and I loved it until it broke after 2 and a half years. This alarm clock will make the perfect replacement. Love love love ihome products."
5,"This is serving it's purpose well. I haven't had any problems with it. It has good quality sound. I use it mostly for talk radio or mp3s with talking on them, but music sounds good on it too."
5,"First I have to say that I am in Wow land. This Zune HD interface was designed to make discovering music fun. Swipe your finger tip up and down to scroll the text menu up and down. Select music, and tap into your favorite playlist. Tap play and start playing the playlist. Okay, easy enough but it gets very fun, read ahead see what I mean.<br /><br />Swipe down to the Radio. Add stations. If you hear a song you like, on the radio, add it to your cart. That's right, add a song you head on the RADIO to your cart. Hit the home button on the bottom to quickly escape the radio. Swipe down to Marketplace, select Cart, and the song you heard on the radio is in the cart. Download it and add it to your permanent collection.<br /><br />It get better. You can do this wirelessly because of the built in WiFi. Now, Sync your Zune HD wirelessly back to the PC to push the song you just downloaded to your PC. How awesome is that. Your Zune Pass Subscription means you can grab all the songs you want.<br /><br />Now, it gets even better.<br /><br />On your Zune HD, go to the Marketplace, and start to tap on songs. You can play them through your wireless WiFi. Okay? Songs you don't even have, you can play right off the market place via WiFi. Think about that for second. If you are home and on your WiFi network, you can listen to any of millions of songs, without downloading them!!<br /><br />Okay, say you find one you really like. Download it. It's all part of your Zune Pass.<br /><br />I have not even scratched the surface.<br /><br />QuickPick<br /><br />That text menu on the home screen? It's one of two menus on the home screen. Swipe to the left on that text. See how there is this small strip of icons on the left side. They become in focus and the large text shrinks off to the right. Now, this little list of icons is huge. Swipe up and down and cruise through the history of the songs you have been playing. Even the radio station you set is here in this history. This strip also contains a QuickPick. So what is a QuickPick?<br /><br />Say you are listening to song and you love it. You just found it on Marketplace and you want to listen to it over and over again until you're tired of it. How to find it easily? Well, tap and hold the album icon while the song is playing. A prompt window will appear and offer to pin the song into QuickPicks.<br /><br />As you explore for music on the radio or the Marketplace, completely wireless, you can easily find those songs again via the QuickPicks or History. That's what that little strip of icons are on the left side of the home screen. Fantastic huh?<br /><br />More fun stuff<br /><br />So I am listening to song and I see the album cover on the display. Tap that screen, and the album dims. A new dimension of menu overlays the album. It's a control surface. You see pause / play in the center. Up and Down are volume up and down. Left and Right are skip left or right. The upper top is to go back. Ignore it for second and it goes away returning the album art to view.<br /><br />The album / song you're playing has a small list under it. That's the songs coming up next! Tap on that little list and your in the list that this song comes from. You can now easily switch to other songs in this list.<br /><br />All of these menus and animated and fluid. It's actually fun to run around within this interface discovering music, adding it to quick picks and retrieving it. It's almost like a dance.<br /><br />Subscription music with the Zune Pass is such a great idea. And it really works with a device like this. Imagine all the ways to discover music, but keep the cost of enjoying all that music to a minimum. That's what the Zune accomplishes.<br /><br />There is so much more. Audible Books works with this. Though you do have to download Audible's Download Manager. I've listened to well over 200 books over the life of my Audible subscription.<br /><br />The Zune Marketplace software for the PC almost mirrors the features ofthe phone in that you can see your quick picks. You have a dashboard that shows you what's going on in your music world. And it gets this information from the device as well. As you add music, the whole ego system gets smarter and exposes you to more music you'll probably like. Absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />Think about it. You can add hundreds of songs a month if you like. Listen to them via radio, and download what you like. Listen live off the Marketplace from your PC or even your Zune portable. What ever you do with the Zune HD will sync back to the PC. In fact, there's more!! I know huh....<br /><br />So you have Zune software on your office PC too, okay...  Listen to this. Go to Settings, Account, Subscription History. Remember, do this on your office PC, not your home PC so you really understand what's about to happen. Those songs you found on the radio, added to cart, and downloaded from the Marketplace are here in this history list even though this office PC had nothing to do with that. It's connected to your account so it knows. And you can, from your work PC, now download those songs to your work PC collection. It's subscription! You can have multiple PCs all connected to your account and they each aware of a collective history of subscribed to music. You don't have to carry songs with you on a thumb drive from your home PC to your office PC. Just let the Zune software show you the history. It tells you what is in your collection on that machine and what is not so you can update your office PC with those great songs you found on the radio or in the marketplace.<br /><br />Hey, do you like Tina Fey's 3rd rock? I sure do. You can download those TV shows as video and watch them on the Zune HD. They have movies too. For rent in SD and HD. I'm watching 21 grams.<br /><br />I have all the free games microsoft added to the apps section. By the way, you can download these from WiFi direct to the device! I've been playing Texas Hold'em.<br /><br />With WiFi, you can use the built in browser to browse web sites. I have The Wall Street Journal, Engadget, PCWorld and several other favorites sites programmed into mine.<br /><br />So, absolutely the best music experience you're ever going to have, because you won't have to worry about money while you download your ears off. Get the Zune Pass and just go crazy. Play games if you like that. Watch TV shows, movies, and music videos. Add your own photos too! Listen to Audible Books. I'm listening to the new John Twelve Hawks 3rd in the-part series of the 4th realm trilogy called The Golden City. Book one is The Traveler. You're missing out if you've never heard of it.

5,"If you live in an urban or suburban area, this antenna will give you too much signal and overload your receiver, this is for deep in boonies, hunting cabins, lake house etc. Urban/suburban applications shop for a 30 mile radius unit."
4,"haven't hung 55in LG flat screen yet, handyman says it looks like it's going to work"
5,"THIS ANTENNA WORKS AS ADVERTISED.<br />WITHOUT IT WE WERE ONLY ABLE TO GET THREE CHANNELS, WITH IT INSTALLED WE RECIEVE 6 OR 7 CHANNELS VERY CLEAR AND SHARP. WE LOVE IT AND THE MONEY IT SAVES US."
3,Wrong instructions were included.
5,Works as advertised upon installation.  No complain whatsoever.  I would buy this again if and when I need another HTML cable.
5,"only moves TV 's angle up and down, no side to side, but for the price, it works well"
3,"I listen to this music system almost everyday - not only because the sound quality is so superior but also because my ipod touch connects to wifi and I can play iradio, pandora and other music streaming sites. Though it is superior to any other docking station I came across, it doesn't justify $300 price tag. One could choose comparable sony music system for much less price. So, I take out 1 point for the hefty price tag.     Second, equlizer adjustments are badly missing. Few simple rock/pop/classic adjustments would have been added. Though I can change it in my ipod touch, I dont like changing settings in ipod touch for each song I play. I wanted that feature in the music system's remote control. For the price I paid, I think it is a genuine expectation. So, I take out another point.    And 3/5 is just fair to the fact that I enjoy listening to it everyday."
5,Great product and great service.
5,Exactly as expected
5,awesome buy at $20 bucks and works great and has been working perfectly for.the last month.  would recommend for anyone wanting to hang the TV or Aston connect to PC as a wireless display device
5,Love it especially after the upgrade.  Had no problems.  Best version yet!<br />I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.
5,"I have co-workers who love to whistle constantly, yell into phones, audibly fart, and make other noises which I can't identify.  Their jobs are menial and require little attention, while I am forced to write programming in the same room, separated by a thin, porous cubicle wall.  These headphones have prevented at least 3 homicides to date, probably more.  They sound great, and the noise cancelling abilities are decent."
4,Its really works fine for my items as well as my son's toys. We both  are happy with this.
4,Arrived on time. good enough to wake my grand daughter
4,"I have had the Sony Network Walkman and the Apple Nano Ipod. <br /> <br />Both sucked with the proprietary software to get MP3s on to the device. <br /> <br />This is the best MP3 player out there right now. <br /> <br />The only reason why I gave it 4 starts was due to the USB cable which has a proprietary connector.  If you lose this cable, you are screwed and will have to try and buy a replacement from SanDisk."
5,"This is REALLY great.  It sounds similar to my husband's Bose. He has an Ipod, I have a Zune.  The sound is crisp and clear and has great base.  I bought 2!"
5,I use this cable to connect to a DLP projector and it works great every time. I use it with my 2012 Mac Book Pro which dual-boots OS X and Windows 7 64-bit and it never fails on either OS.
5,"I bought these from Apple, and I msut say they are jsut GREAT! <br />Pros: <br />-Almost-noise cancelling, when off you can still ahve convorsations. <br />-Comfertable fit! And it comes in Medium, LArge, and small sizes! <br />-Strong cord. <br />Cons: <br />-Hard to get used to at first <br />-sometimes you ahve to really push hard to get them in <br /> <br />Really, that's it! I prefer them A LOT over the base earphones. In all, these are a great edition for ANY iPod or msuic lsitening device! :D"
5,"Better sound and picture than the IPod.  Easy to download songs, pictures and video.  All that and $70 cheaper."
4,"We've purchased many Zen products over the years and we like the small size and usebility of this model.  The battery life is ridiculously long, MUCH better than the larger Zen M's but that's good because the only way to charge this little one is thru the USB (unless you purchase the charger extra I think).    Zen's have been good products for us in general but they definitely have a shelf life.  We don't handle them rough but accidents do happen so maybe it's that they've been dropped a certain way but each one just suddenly has stopped working at one point and it's been futile to troubleshoot it or reinstall the firmware.  It's been frustrating and we are hopeful the Mosaics will last longer than the M's.    We are not big users of the firmware for creating playlists and we would probably have an easier time if we learned how to use the software more effectively.  But that's our own fault, not Creative's.    My recommendation is that if you can get away with the smaller GB model like this 4gb Mosaic, the price and all it's other positive features makes it the perfect little Mp3.  Would definitely buy another one if we were looking."
3,"I was excited to get these speakers and planned to add them to my system as a pair of back speakers to complement to two studio monitors and mid-size two-way speakers from Acoustic Research.  I planned to drive them through my vintage Pioneer integrated amp.<br /><br />With all the power needed, I hooked up the speakers.  They are very easy to connect - either with plain wire ends or connectors, simply thread the finger-nuts down tight and the speakers are connected with color-coded terminals.<br /><br />The front grills remove easily and snap back on positively.<br /><br />The black cabinets will go well with most systems.<br /><br />In short a good looking speaker that's easy to connect, and small enough to place in a number of locations.<br /><br />I turned on my amp and started playing a favorite CD.  I'm sorry to say that the speakers were not pleasing to my ears.  Keep in mind that speaker \\""sound\\"" is subjective.  I have Infinity Reference series speakers in my cars, Acoustic Research studio monitors in my house (the old \\""real\\"" AR speakers), and Bose system for the \\""good\\"" TV in the family room.  The sound I like is no doubt tied to my habit of listening to these speakers.<br /><br />I found the JBL Balboa to be hollow sounding.  While crisp and clean, they are overly loud in the mid-range.  The bass wasn't as solid as my other speakers.<br /><br />These are good speakers for low volume-level listening and would probably work as an element in a low- or mid-level surround-sound system as speakers for secondary sound.  But placed in the middle of a high-end stereo system they were out of place.  They're a good value for the price but don't expect to \\""Wow\\"" anyone with them."
5,What can I say! so far it seems as though I's making my grandchildren happy because this item was purchased for my granddaughter. She looooooves them!! I'm glad I could make her happy.
5,Works Great. No problems. Just plugged it in and it did it's job. Now my TV is connected to my computer and I can use it as both a computer screen and a TV by just switching from HDMI to TV on the remote control SOURCE button.
3,"The sound from this thing is amazing. The base is rich and room-filling. On several occasions I've used it with the provided adapter connected to a laptop. After about 10 used, the adapter stopped working. When I tried to pair it to the device, the speaker would just turn off. I've performed this within the auto-turn-off time frame. I don't know if I am missing something and reading manual doesn't help. I am still happy with it on use with a smartphone but wish that connection to the pc still works."
5,This case was actually better than the one offer by Bose at a fraction of the cost.
5,Thank you
5,"My ears are hard to fit (small holes?) and these earhook headphones are great.  The earhooks are completely adjustable and feel comfortable for hours of wear.  I don't run, so I don't know how stable they are but I believe they would be fine.  I recommend these to anyone.  Wynn B."
5,Can't believe somehing so small can hold so much data. I am enjoying my nano! Wish it would have come with a car charger
5,It took some planning and measuring and the use of a stud finder was very helpful. Mine came with instructions only for concrete/brick walls. If you're application is into regular study/drywall rooms then here's your guide:<br /><br />Step 1: use stud finder to find edges of studs and mark them.<br />Step 2: measure for desired height of tv/mount and mark holes for lag screws (6 inches apart (center to center) top to bottom)<br />Step 3: mark holes for third (and/or 4th) screws on each arm of mount. note these will not go into a stud...read on:<br />Step 4: use toggle anchors or I recommend using Cobra Driller Toggle drywall anchors for securing extra bolts in drywall applications<br />Step 5: drill pilot holes for lag screws and anchors<br />Step 6: screw in anchors<br />Step 7: have someone hold up the mount while you screw in two of the stud side lag screws on one of the mount arms (helper dismissed till step 12)<br />Step 8: screw in lag screws for other mount arm<br />Step 9: screw in bolts for anchors<br />Step 10: use built in level to adjust level-ness and then tighten the screws securing mount arms to mount surface<br />Step 11: bolt mounting brackets to tv - back out the screws that will secure the brackets to the mount from underneath.<br />Step 12: use helper to help hang tv/brackets onto mount (helper dismissed!)<br />Step 13: tighten underside screws to secure brackets to mount<br />Step 14: enjoy / sigh relief!<br /><br />Install certainly takes some measuring and planning but it's worth it. My wife and I have our 55&#34; tv hanging from the wall with this mount so that it is on there rock solid. There is NO CHANCE of the TV falling over if kids are running/jumping around in the living room. (Important especially if you have a wii!)  I'm a worry wort and I feel much safer with the tv bolted to both walls of the corner with this rock solid mount. Love it.
4,"Considering the amount of them you get for the money they are not a bad deal. It wasn't exactly as I was expecting for a micro fiber cloth. I was looking for the kind that I get from the eye clinic that comes with my glasses, but can't seem to find that kind. These are a little fuzzier but do work and seems to do the job."
5,"I am very happy with this alarm clock. It has a lot of features and also allows for adjusting the brightness of the digital clock. Also, the radio sounds pretty good for it's size, if you like to wake up to the sound of music."
4,"After having some of the reviews, I had high hopes for these ear phones but I'm a little disappointed. The audio quality is definately good, especially the bass, but i feel the treble can be a little piercing and the the mid could be clearer. Although this definately depends on the the genre and quality of music you're listening to.  These are the first in-ear headphones i've owned so they're not as comfortable as out ear headphones i think.     These are still definately very good headphones, especially for the price. I would reccomend them for people who enjoy heavy bass, but there might be better options if you're looking for more balanced sound."
1,"(Although the product is not exactly the same as my purchase, they are very similar; so take this review at that) I purchased the STR-DE995 7.1 &quot;Home theater&quot; receiver. After less than one year, it deteriorated into an overpriced stereo receiver. For your amusement, I attached the letter I sent to SONY of America's CEO. <br />  <br /> Mr. Howard Stringer, <br />  <br /> I am writing to inform you that your company has just lost my business. Over the years I have purchased many products from Sony and its subsidiaries, including a SONY Walkman, a Car Discman, 3 stereo receivers, a CD/DVD 5 disc changer, a WEGA TV, a PlayStation and its software, and DVDs and CDs distributed by SONY and its subsidiaries Columbia and Epic. <br />  <br /> With the recent purchase of the SONY STR-DE995 receiver, I experienced audio problems 9 months from the date of purchase. The chronology of action taken is outlined below. <br />  <br /> In an email, I wrote: <br /> &quot;Audio problem - When Dolby/dts (or any surround format) is selected a rhythmic, chirping noise is sounded through the center and rear speakers (currently have 5.1 setup). The noise is amplified as the volume increases. There is no recognizable noise when the receiver is in stereo <br /> mode (since the surround speakers are not enabled). I've tried the following connections: RCA analog, Digital Coaxial, and Digital optical. The receiver is stored in an entertainment center, and is connected to a SonicBlue ReplayTV DVR and Sony DVP-NC655P (both devices have the same sound output problem). The audio problem began about 2 weeks ago. No devices/cables/wires have been added or removed leading up to the problem. I've had no other problems with this device.&quot; <br />  <br /> Follow-up email from customer service stated the problem would need to be serviced. My reply: <br /> &quot;The service offered is very unsatisfactory. I treat and have treated all my electronic devices in excellent condition, and this productwas purchased less than a year ago (09/26/2003). The recommendation was to have it serviced. Since the closest Sony Service Center is over 2 hours away and the closest authorized center is 45 min away, I'd have to mail it to one of <br /> the centers. Figuring 2 business days to and from the center and about 3-5 days to be serviced (if it can be repaired at all); that would leave me without a receiver for at least 2 weeks. With the many years doing business with Sony, I expect its receiver to be fully operational for many years, not just 9 months. Also, the out of pocket expenses that would be charged at my expense to get the receiver to one of the service centers is not acceptable. <br />  <br /> I take a great deal of time researching the best products for the resources I have available to me; when I decide to purchase that product I not only expect the product to be exceptional, but the service as well. Therefore, since the product is under warranty, I want the STR-DE995 replaced with a new one, and I will ship the &quot;problem&quot; receiver to Sony at its expense.&quot; <br />  <br />  <br /> A 2nd follow-up email was sent stating customer service would need to be phoned. When I spoke with a rep this morning, he stated SONY's policy would not be able to honor my request as stated in the above email. When no progress had been made I requested to speak to the manager. He said he was the manager. I reiterated my request to speak to his supervisor. He then transferred me to a rep named Luke. He basically mimicked what the precious rep had told me; insisting policy must be adhered to. I continued the conversation stating, I expect perfection in the products I buy and the service that comes with that product. He replied that SONY equipment is constructed by humans and mistakes will be made. With that said, am I to believe that now and in the future I can expect less than perfect products from SONY? Even if my receiver is serviced, what's to guarantee there will beno other underlying problems? He didn't have the knowledge to answer my questions; instead he repeated the warranty policy. I went on to say, if SONY will not compensate me with a new receiver and pay for shipping costs, it will lose my business and will recommend to my friends and family to do the same. He told me I shouldn't base this decision on emotion, and tried to explain to me how businesses worked. I cut his rhetoric short by restating my position. He offered to fill out a service request. I said, you have lost my business and be sure to pass the message onto your supervisor. <br />  <br /> With the end of the conversation, the SONY Car Discman that I've been using at my workplace for the past 6 years went right in the garbage. I will not advertise SONY or any of its subsidiaries. I will not purchase any SONY product and encourage my friends and family to do the same. I will not buy advertising that supports the Spider-Man franchise or Columbia/Tri-Star films, nor those products advertised on Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy!. Finally, until I have the resources, I will be replacing all my SONY products with non-affiliated brands."
5,This work out great I live in BFE and I get like 40 channels more than enough for me I would like try the other one that has booster in it..
4,works as advertised take some getting use to if you have not had one before. Except for power it is very easy to hook up they give you all you need.
5,great value
5,"Works great, quality great"
5,This pocket has worked well for me.
4,Deep bass and almost entire sound range that I can hear is accurately reproduced. These stop producing sound at about 21khz. The downside is that my left one has recently decided to play music at a much lower volume than the right. I've had them for 3 years so it was a good run but it seems like some manufacturer should be able to make something that just keeps working. Another downside is that the best fitting ear pieces only do a mediocre job of keeping the buds in my ears while exercising.
5,This IPOD  docking speaker is great for the price.  The sound is great and there is so much bass.  I am not dissapointed with this purchase.
5,This battery was the perfect fit for my home alarm system. No more annoying beeps going off constantly and it was reasonably priced!.
1,This item does not work.  I tried it with my Ps3 and it did not work on either an HD TV or a monitor.  It was a waste of money.
5,"I used these to mount a Homegear 120&#34; screen.  These things are perfect.  Just what you need to mount a projector screen.<br />Very sturdy, made of metal.<br />You can mount on the tips, or within the slot in the middle to set the position closer to the wall.  Mounting in the slot allows you to adjust height on each side so you can be sure it's level.<br />Worth the price to simplify the installation."
4,I wanted to give this unit a shot despite all the bad reviews. Glad I did. It has a lot of features - takes some getting used to. No issues so far.
5,"Smartest battery charger I got yet. It's great, it knew what batteries were defective and charges individual AA or AAA batteries. Takes the guess work out pairing batteries and finding defective/low batteries that kills your good phones.<br /><br />It's not fast, but I've got 2-3 dozen of AA and AAA batteries to keep my controllers going even when friends come over. I don't feel bad trying to top off batteries either as it does a better job of topping off or trickle charging than any of the Name brand chargers (Duracell, Energizer, Rayovac, etc)."
2,"This product was great! for about a month, I loved the simplicity of it, never had any issues with it being dirty, ran it about every day to humidify the room and could point the mist direction exactly where I needed it to go. Loved it!<br /><br />That is, until one night I turned it off woke up the next morning turned it on and poof the mist was gone, I can still hear the motor working although it does not do anything anymore!<br /><br />Ugh back to square one of trying to find a good and lasting humidifier that has a spout.<br /><br />Too expensive to just randomly quit working!"
3,The material isn't great. Doesn't dry hardly at all.
4,"This product tastes good, they are a bit smaller than some others I have had locally but this was a product that I would buy again."
5,Excellent
1,"This foil is so thin that if a mosquito were to fly into it, his proboscis would puncture it. It is impossible to even tear a piece off without ripping it. Straight into the recycling it goes!"
5,These multis have been working for me for a couple of years now. I have tried others but eventually go back to this one.<br /><br />They have the proper dosages and you only need to take one a day.
5,"Works great, can use for items other than shoes also."
1,Junk
2,"When I received it, it was broken. Not happy"
1,"Seal was broken & one pill was missing. Not chancing it, returning!"
1,Very Difficult to understand directions. Never did figure out how to get calorie count. Ended up buying another brand because i couldn't get any help from the company.
2,"I ordered a black but received a white instead. :(<br /><br />The product it self, just used for half day and it seems pretty supportive."
5,"It was recommended that I get this product for post-op meniscus knee surgery, by friends and professionals. I am glad I acted on the advice. You don't want to keep running,or hobbling, to the refrigerator for ice or bags of peas...this you only need to add ice every six hours or so. As all told me, ice is your friend for the first few days. I did buy the medium size one, I am female 120 pounds. This product was more than worth the cost."
5,The capsules are easier to swallow & it is just as effective as the other product with the same ingredients that was twice the price.<br /> Thank you for both the quality & the value.
5,"I had bought the insoles from the same company and loved them so I thought I'd give the seatpad a try. It's really thin and portable so I can take it anywhere and it really helps alleviate my back and bottom pain when I sit for long periods of time. You will notice the effect right away, and even more over time.<br /><br />Thanks."
4,yay it a supplementOMG
5,"This product works! I started losing weight in the first week. It helps curb my appetite and doesn't give me any negative side effects!<br />I thought that it would be hard to take that many pills, but once you get into the routine it's easy.<br />When you make your purchase, they give you a chance to get a second bottle free! I am definitely claiming mine and will continue to use this product. All I had to do in return is write a review. And I wouldn't waste my time on writing this if I didn't want more Garcinia Cambogia!"
5,"I don't normally buy diet plan stuff, but on a whim, I tried these. They are great. Just before a workout, they give some extra energy. They also taste great. The mint ones too."
5,"These are awesome! Great for peeing off a boat, while hiking etc. haven't had any messes. Might be brave enough to try it while skiing next winter."
5,"Great for dry ear canals too. Terrific for defeating sore ears caused by swimming combined with winter weather. Calms irritation making infections much less likely. In my case, eliminated getting ear infections altogether. Calms minor irritation caused by earplugs and hearing aides. Highly recommend!"
5,Nothing tastes better
5,"Marked by or providing unrestrained gratification; self-indulgent. This soap is for Patchouli lovers! While it isn't the longest lasting soap, the smell is divine and the lather is our of this world!"
5,"Gummies arent just for kids, these are great !!"
5,Wow!
5,This thing does what it is suppose to do so I love it. I needed to file down one of the nodes because the plastic was pulling on my hair which was annoying. But now it's tug free!
3,"This product mixes very well in a blender. The taste is good - even better if you throw in a handful of assorted berries.<br /><br />I gave it a 3-star because it does NOT mix well with a spoon or in a shaker cup. Unless you enjoy eating clumps of protein powder, I would recommend that you only use this product with a blender, or go with a different product."
1,"I work out 4 days a week and after I felt nothing from phentermine, I tried this. No energy, no nothing even after I doubled the dose so that's 4 twice a day."
5,"I like these brush heads, they are &#34;hard&#34; and I feel that my teeth are really getting a thorough cleaning. For the price, you just can't go wrong."
5,Perfect gift.
5,I loved these filters. They fit like they are supposed to. They last a couple of months in my home which is very dusty (the air return is in the utility room where the dryer is located) and are easy to insert and remove. All-in-all a good deal.
3,"Nothing wrong with it, its been very durable...Its just not amazing. It'll get you by but there are better options even for the low price"
5,"I've used serveral different brands for coconut oil and this brand is my favorite for several reasons. 1. Packaging...comes in a user friendly heavy duty plastic tub which makes it easy to store and scoop and the opening is perfect for measuring spoons or regular spoons and mini spatulas to get the very last bit. 2. Texture.....much creamier texture than most brands and melts smoother when warmed up. 3. Taste...I know a lot of cooks and chefs prefer a more neutral flavor but I personally love the more pronounced smell and hint of coconut. 4. Versatility...with the everyday user in mind I love to use this oil for popcorn, sauteing veggies or roasting as well as using as a scalp and hair treatment and makes for a wonderfully gentle makeup remover esp for the hard to budge waterproof mascara...be sure to rinse away from eyes very well tho...can block the delicate pores! I have also used this stuff to remove adhesive from my hands mixed up with a shake or two of salt!"
5,"After using 4 tubes, as far as we can tell it is just as good as the name brand selling for $10 per 2 oz tube at the drugstore."
5,This massager feels soooooo good. The first time I used it I purred like a kitten. Definitely relieves stress and stimulate the scalp. Love it!
1,"Just a plain sponge, no cleaning properties at all. The only Magic was that my money was cleaned from my wallet. "
5,"Amazing nail light! Perfect for what I need. Very useful timer options on the back. Very pleased with my lamp it looks very nice & works very well & very good value for money. Bought this lamp after reading the review, but unfortunately the two then three bulbs started blink and then turning off. Contacted company directly and new bulbs were sent straight away and it works brilliantly! Amazing customer service and a truly effective light that cures well in a few minutes using harmony gelish."
2,They are the wrong size for the styler that I have so I can't even make them fit onto the hair dryer.
5,My daughter is a professional dancer and swears by these.
1,To hard to use. May have already trashed it.
5,My favorite go to vitamin. It literally has everything you need!
5,Once before my hemoglobin was down to 6.9 and Vitron C helped get it back up. Now it went down to 8 so I ordered this again since it worked so well before. I would recommend it.
5,"First time I did not buy directly from PureHealth. Amazon did not carry 90 count bottles. Had to buy two. Product is still the same, but probably will go back and buy 90 count botgtles from PureHealth in the future. Having excellent weight loss results. Highly recommend and so does Dr. Oz."
5,"Great product, the skin around my eyes appear smoother and less tired. It is part of my nightly regime now."
5,Excellent
5,"I will be 50 years old next month and have enjoyed playing basketball with my sons for years. Over the five or so years, I have had to &#34;pay&#34; big time several days after playing, as my knees would ache terribly. After trying different joint supplements with minimal success, I have found Dr. Miller's Joint Repair to be the most beneficial in alleviating knee pain after basketball workouts. Thank you for your excellent product!"
4,They work.
5,"I have been searching for a reputable, organic, GMO free, probiotic formula to take because of being on antibiotics for 4 months due to a super bug called cdiff. The antibiotics also destroyed all the good bacteria in me which helped the super bug to grow and keep coming back. So far, this formula, along with the prebiotic formula to feed the good bacteria, has worked very well and I feel very healthy finally! I know it's not a cure and no medical claims have been made by this company to help prevent diseases but feeling healthy and energetic is all that counts with me at this point. Also, make sure it's delivered with an ice pack. It's very important to refrigerate to keep the good bacteria alive."
2,"i did not buy my machine from Amazon, but was very unhappy with the machine. it was great for rolling half cigaretts, never could get it to fill the whole tube. gave it away with hopes they would have better luck, and bought the same brand of my first electric roller. it lasted for 3 years rolling for 3 people."
4,"This is my second toy. If you want something tight, then this isn't for you. But it still has a very nice feel. It's also transparent, which makes it a different experience being able to see yourself inside it. Plus, it's only ten bucks. Easy to clean. Tough to beat for the price."
5,Awesome to get these so quickly and at a low price! My book light never shined so bright! :) Definitely recommend!
5,"It holds all types of medicine! Just like it said! Isn't that crazy!?!?<br />SO SAYETH I, THE GREAT GYPSY JONES!"
5,I purchased this for my diabetic nephew. I am definitely satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone
1,This ended up being a waste of money. It's just too thick and is in clean very well. Soaks up the cleaner way too much
3,I like it so far haven't been taking them long but seems to be helping my joint pain.
5,"I wasn't to sure about with some of the reviews, but decided to try it. It doesn't taste that bad, I like it not being strong like some regular brands. The tan color you get use to. They say it helps your gums stay or get healthy, so we will see, so far so good.<br />I will be buying it again."
1,I guess I did not read the description close enough but be careful because this is not &#34;pure&#34; oil of oregano but a blend with olive oil and if you are looking to use it as a immune booster as I was it is not the right product. I should of guessed due to the lower price but Amazon is great and they refunded half of the cost when I submitted a refund request. At least I did not lose out completely.
5,Does what it is supposed to
5,This is a set of 4 different size magnifying glasses. They are all optical glass and far better than expected. Quality product. Best price around!
1,"Have had two of these sound machines in the past with no problems. The one ordered thru Amazon and Dream Sales which I received was defective. Was very pleased with Amazon's fast response. Was a little surprised that noone asked if I wanted a replacement;however was impressed that I got a speedy response with a credit issued immediately. Also, did not receive any instructions as to what to do with the product I received, if anything."
5,I started to take this to Aide in a Liver and Kidney problem I was having.<br />This is my New Best Friend as my Liver Enzymes dropped significantly after only 1 month of use @ 2 Caps a Day.
5,"This is the protein bar for me! I love having one after a run. It is chewy, with a little gooey, and a great crunch factor - probably because there are real nuts all up in there. It is delicious - more like a candy bar than a protein bar. There's no aftertaste, no weird sour milk taste that I find so often in other protein bars, no chalkiness, no grittiness, and it's got some moistness even.<br /><br />Sure there are bars out there with slightly better numbers, but, at 13.6 calories per gram of protein, this one is in the top because when it comes to taste and texture - it doesn't get any better.<br /><br />I've only tried two of this brand, the Almond Fudge Brownie and a cookie flavored one, the cookie one was pretty good, too, but not as good as this one."
5,"This is by far the best choice for post-work recovery supplement for vegans who are highly active and pay very close to the ingredients of the products they buy. Although, I wish we could get more product for the price we are paying."
3,didn't work so well for me.
3,I haven't used these yet with my boots since it is summer but I am hoping that will make my boots more comfortable.
5,Great for the price. Ordering it again.
5,These work well with my foodsaver and I have had no issues with them. They are of good quality and less expensive than at the stores.
5,"I am a nutty Oral Care person, flossing rountinely and brushing. One day I saw the Tung Brush & Gel in a store after reading how important it is to brush your tongue, removes bad bacteria and cleanses your breath. So, I gave it a try. It is by far the best thing I have ever done. It makes my mouth feel clean, really clean. So, my daily regime is brush, floss and Tung Brush."
5,Have been able to come off all meds for depression as well as sleeping pills. Have had no side effects and same dose continues to work for depression and insomnia. Give it a try....
5,works as expected. satisfied so far.
5,"I have always been skeptical about products like these, and have always just thought of them as a company wanting to take your money and sale you a false hope. With this product I was proven to be absolutely wrong. My Skin is brighter, and when I look in the mirror I can see my face... the way it used to be. I have lost so many inches around my midsection, OMG, Legs, arms and even around my head. Yes I said it, my head, the extra chin I had developed has gotten himself lost, LOL. I say See Ya Later. This product is wonderful, and by the time for my family reunion no one will be able to stop me. I mean this product has given me so much energy, I have even had to step up the intensity in my work out regimen to keep up with myself. I you are thinking of getting this and are having mixed feelings, don't, get it, try it, and you will like me, Love it."
1,Don't waste your time.<br />Probably won't fit no matter what the description says.<br />I was very hopeful and careful before I ordered this.<br />I read everything. Still didn't fit even though it said it would.
5,"I typically have to go to the wholesale place to get a price like this, which is not convenient. This showed up in one day, thanks!"
4,pro: steam source (good for a cold or respiratory congestion). con: regular maintenance is required
5,"these are great for anyone who has big feet and needs compression socks. The closed toe kind hurt my toes, because I wear a size 15 shoe, but these are perfect. Fit without crowding my toes up"
4,"My son does not enjoy the taste, but I am pleased with the list of vitamins and minerals included."
5,Fantastic product! Instantly makes me feel fuller. This is my second order of this. Great value and great for adding fiber when you can't get it in your diet.
5,"This is the only time-released niacin made of nicotinic acid, the right kind of niacin for cardiac benefits, so I can take two and know that they are circulating all day. I like this brand better than the ones I find in the store and the price is good. Great product, in my opinion."
5,So I never used it myself or anything lol.<br />But she said it was great. Then she took it in the shower and killed it.<br /><br />So I had to order another one.<br />Seems to work pretty good. No charging problems or anything. Just dont take a hot bath with it and you'll be fine.lol
5,Yes!
4,"First off, I love the colors it comes with. You can wear them in coordinating colored bras so they blend in, which makes a huge difference. I also love how soft and absorbent these nursing pads are! They are easy to wash and dry so I don't feel so wasteful using disposable pads everyday. I would recommend these to all nursing moms!"
2,"Great idea, but unfortunately, breaks easily. I bought one for a patient and she loved it, especially since it was clear. However, it has very little &#34;stretchability&#34; and after a couple runs in the dishwasher, broke in half."
4,I like the how easy the pacs are to use. They clean well and remove stains also. My only complaint is they seem to get sticky if you don't put them in an airtight container. I will buy them again.
5,"After almost going through one jug of this I can honestly say way more than satisfied. I was looking, when I ordered, for something to supplement my workout routines without having to sacrifice my health in doing so, so if you're like me and want something without harsh side effects then give this stuff a try. I wish I had more, and I'm about to order some more. I'm 5'11, 150-160 lbs. Nice amino-acid complex and decent protein. It's also VERY good for GERD sufferers.<br /><br />With regards to the taste. I found it rather bland. It doesn't mix, and clumps up. So, I just chew it like candy in a glass of milk. Doesn't really taste like anything at all."
5,nice deal
5,"This product was recommended by a friend. I'm glad to have it. Has none of the problems associated with Rx sleep aids. I just take half a pill od Sleep Aid. The pills are scored, so they're easy to break in half."
3,Nice strart
5,"In my opinion, its worth the money. If they increase the price, I'd still buy it. I did gain a few pounds of muscle because of the higher levels of testosteron.. A couple noticeable effects other than probably a slight placebo effect that helped in the gym.<br />Definitely increased my libido and made me more excited in the bedroom. Wifey loved that.<br />Worth trying! That's for sure"
5,They certainly don't roll! Will be purchasing more.
1,"These are horrible and smell horrible! They all smell the same and stink coming from the box. Just an example that you get what you pay for. I will be continuing to purchase my oils from the health food store, even at a greater cost."
3,The presentation of this toy does not make it at all clear that you only get one chew and one lanyard. I cannot believe I paid 12.50 for a piece of chewy material and a lanyard. Really? My son is going to be so disappointed that there is just a yellow fish. :(
3,"I'm still not sure what my final opinion of this product will be. You will usually need a blender to mix this. Taste is okay, I usually mix fruit in it so I'm not too picky about the taste just as long as it isn't a bad chocolate flavor. Seems like it definitely helps me hit calorie totals; I do a lot of cardio stuff in addition to free weight training and products like this make it easy to get the extra needed calories even if I'd rather eat real food. It's the convenience factor that makes this product valuable."
5,Great product
5,"Folks, this is my favorite flavor of emergen-c! I was so surprised to read the reviews on the taste and smell, that I had to write a quick review.<br /><br />I personally do not like most of the emergen-c flavors that people like, but I kept drinking it, knowing all the benefits. Then, I finally found a taste I love and can drink with pleasure...this one. I guess this stuff is very taste specific...just find the flavor that suits your palette best and drink up! ;-)<br /><br />For those of you that might not know much about this product, here are a few facts:<br />1. It contains bio-available forms of certain vitamins and minerals (for instance, C is included in zinc ascorbate and chromium ascobate forms)<br />2. It does NOT contain aspartame or sucralose las in Airbourne; instead, it uses stevia.<br />3. It contains no artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives.<br />4. It contains 1000IU of vitmain D3 without including a potentially dangerous level of vitamin A palimate (also in Airbourn)<br /><br />This is truly a superior product in terms of vitamins and minerals when compared to its competitors. Now all you need to do is find a flavor you love. Good luck!"
5,"Great price, and fast delivery!"
5,"Absolutely gets the knots out. Able to move it around to various spots. Not quite the same experience as the one that moves up and down your back, but if you have a particular area that needs work, you can't beat it."
2,Too loud and noisy. Do not waste your money.
4,Works very well on stains and extra soil. You do need to put it<br />on a few minutes before you start your laundry. Not good to leave<br />it on too long.
5,"When you need a bag, but don't want to buy one. Just have a few items this is your bag. I keep it in my jacket when waking in case I stop and pick up a few things. I bought two, one for my neighbor. Good buy!!"
1,they put poop in a capsule and branded it as sea mussels. POOP. Terrible. Might as well have eaten sugar capsules.
4,"Very slick at first, but does not last very long."
3,I can't smell anything!
1,"I am trying to lose a few (8-10 lbs) to get down to my ideal weight of 120. I eat healthy and exercise lightly (eliptical) four times a week. I have been having trouble reaching goal even with using my fit bit tracker, so I thought I 'd give the ketones a try. fter all the reviews were excellent. Well, I gave it a month, tried both the pills and the drops. I even added Tonalin CLA but I didn't lose an ounce. The shipping and service was fine, but the ketones didn't seem to work for me. If you are close to your ideal weight it may not be the best choice. I wasted my mo"
5,Great product!
5,great item recomend
1,"Received product in a blank white box with no manufacturer information no fancy packaging and a very generic typed out instruction sheet, which wouldn't have mattered much but when I went to pump it up it sprang a leak right off the bat and deflated after about 5 seconds. I was really disappointed as I suffer chronic neck pain and chiro suggested it. I couldn't even contact the seller or manufacturer as I had no info on or in the box. Be careful or you might be in for more of an expense to send it back!"
5,"Great, natural product that helps with inflammation and pain. I used on a torn tendon and it has helped me heal. Tendons can be tough to heal without surgery but I feel this cream has helped. I also used on an inflammed bursa on the back of my heel and the lump is completely gone. Don't expect overnight relief, it is not a miracle (healing takes patience) but with consistent use I found it to be very helpful."
2,"I tried this product on my mole in the center of my chest...<br />and even though it &#34;leveled&#34; it somewhat, it did not completely remove the mole from me.<br /><br />I guess I'll have to eventually have a doctor remove mine."
5,came as described
5,"I have used this product since 1990 when I lived in France. It is magnificent and 100% natural. The only downfall is that once opened, it needs to be used within 30 days."
4,Good product
2,"This charging cable doesn't work. It lacks the pinhole needed to restart the fitbit. I should have read the description and reviews more carefully. Because it cost as much as an official fitbit charger, I somehow assumed it was the same quality. It isn't and I will be returning it."
5,Fast service and cuff was exactly as described and shown.
5,"Beta-Alanine is an ingredient backed by science, and NOW Foods provides it in bulk at a great price. If you're looking to dose beta-alanine, you're far better off purchasing it in bulk rather than buying it in a proprietary formula!"
5,the best color they make!!!!!!
5,Wish i had measured a bit before purchase but figure i could use another in a longer length.
5,Used in conjunction with Digestion GB to treat Acid reflux and assist with digestion after gallbladder removal. Taken with meal. In our daily regime for 18+ months.
4,"The fabric is very high quality, stretches well and provides very good compression around the ankle. Much better material than other ankle sleeves I've tried, it seems very solidly made. Support is okay, but you shouldn't depend on an ankle sleeve for support. Inversion sprains are just as likely--you need a sturdy lace-up ankle brace to prevent those. This is for warmth and compression, similar to why bikers wear spandex tights. Support seems better than ankle sleeves with an open heel though, however, the top part of this ankle sleeve digs into the top of my ankle bone, where it creases when I dorsi-flex my ankle. So its uncomfortable when I run with it on. I don't know if it's because of the closed toe design, but i'll update if the crease discomfort goes away after continued use"
5,"Excellent product for skin repair or dry skin. It is not greasy and has a wonderful fragrance. Unfortunately, my dogs like to lick it..."
5,Loved them. Great price.
3,Waste of money. Doesn't help with fat burning or cellulite clearing at all. Feels decent as a back massager though so I'll give it 3 stars.
1,You'll get sick!
2,"i liked the price for this diffuser and it worked well for about 3 months. i bought 2 more and they only lasted 6-8 months. sad! not worth the money, ill buy a different brand now"
4,"This razor shaves very close, and the handle is comfortable, not too small, not too bulky. Great control for a cut-proof shave"
5,i like how this is natural and vegan. I got this when i was pregnant and i'm still taking it now.
4,"Nice. I may order another for myself. This one is for my daughter. She doesn't like a fan blowing on her, but complains about the house noise after her bedtime."
5,Excellent product. it is now very easy to take my calcium.
5,I have these auto delivered by Amazon. I find the price and convenience of doing so worth it. Since doing so I've cut down on the amount of paper towels we use. Brawny absorbs better and is thicker than the generic brands I was using.<br />I love having them delivered (no fee with Prime) its one less bulky item to deal with.<br />This is good stuff!
4,"Lots of advantages. It isn't irritating, smells better and less medicinal than many topical liniments, and it's not greasy nor does it stain. But it's not for really BAD days. I will buy it again, because not every day is bad..........."
3,I favor the Think Thin bars but I thought I'd give these a try since they are cheaper. I particularly didn't care for the taste or texture but they do have 20g of protein and I didn't feel hungry for hours after eating one. Half way through I was getting sick of chewing it so I had to wash it down with a diet coke. Try the Think Thin bars. They cost more but much more enjoyable!
5,matched the right table to walker and works better than a basket. much more versatile. sturdy design makes it feel secure to put items on.
1,Cannot get this product to even come on.
1,Not a no tear product... Just states it wont run into the babies eyes. Have not even used it... Do not want to chance it.
5,I like to try new and interesting products - and this Braun shaver and cleanser are both practical and attractive.
4,"I am not sure about the science of magnetic therapy and how it is supposed to help with arthritis, but this bracelet is good looking. If it helps with my aches and pains, that will be a bonus. So far it is holding up well, as I plan on wearing it constantly. I will revise my review in a few months to let you know if I receive any therapeutic benefits."
5,I take these to support my fatty liver problem.
5,"I make homemade toothpaste and this powder is exactly the texture and quality I look for. The order arrived well-packed and in good time. The inner package is of re-sealable mylar -- nice because it seals very tightly so the calcium carbonate does not absorb moisture, but remains perfectly dry and ready to use when I need it. This is not the first time I have ordered products from Bulk Supplements, and I will definitely order from them again. All their products that I have tried have been clean, dry, well-packed and top quality."
2,"Very slick true enough, but dries very quickly!"
5,"This is an excellent product. It is easy to clean, easy to use, with no extra parts to clean or lose."
5,"Not much to say other than the product is well made, worth every penny."
5,"I tried many diets pills before from almost every company. All the pills seem to give me the headache and heart racing affect. Best slim gave me best result, within first week I lost 5 pounds and within this first month I lost over 15 pounds. Even though this might not be the real deal, but since been taking this I lost the weight I don't need. I just got 10 more pounds to lose. Best slim is the way to lose weight with no weird feeling affect."
5,As described & delivered on time!
4,As described
3,Bought this for my twins for meds for thrush. They were 3 months. It is a great idea however it is hard to hold because of the size
5,I love using these air fresheners! Thank you very much for your competitive pricing so I can afford them! Thanks!
4,Works but all flavors aren't so great. Worth the but.
5,Great product! I used it mostly when I was just starting to nurse my daughter and had a lot of issues with chapped nipples. I liked that I could apply the product and it was not necessary to wipe off prior to breast feeding.
5,For moms with young children or for adults with tender noses. These gentle wipes are easy to carry around and never dry out. Noses that need wiping or chocolates faces that need cleaning..........the smell is pleasant so children don't run when they see you coming.
5,I have been using this lactose intolerance product for over a year and it is fantastic. It not only works much better than competitive products it also eliminates the hassle of remembering to take pills every time dairy products are consumed. I take one every morning and no longer worry about what dairy products I eat or when I eat them. This is a miracle drug if ever there was one!
5,This product really helps me sleep! I highly recommend it!
5,"Best sleep mask, even when the sun is fully out I cannot see any light. Will get more once i use this one."
5,I have been using this brand of fish oil for several years now and I still find it to be the best. The lemon flavor is very good!
2,"I was very excited to purchase the Omron Full Body Comp Scale. It appeared to be state of the art and with its 4 point of contact I was hoping for extremely, or more accurate body fat numbers. In 24 hour spans there were BODY FAT swings of 4% or more. I know from being involved in fitness that these types of swings are highly improbable, some would say impossible.<br /><br />The scale also has an \\""Age\\"" feature, which uses an algorithm that produces your \\""Body Age\\"". As someone who trains 5 days a week and engages in a very active lifestyle my \\""Age\\"" was consistently 80 years old!<br /><br />I am starting to believe that our technology just is not yet available to offer a cost effective methodology of accurately measuring body fat. I have used Omron before and they get high grades in construction and durability. My hope was for a device that if not record accurate BODY FAT measurements at least record consistent records so you could gauge if you were moving in the right direction. Unfortunately that does not seem to be the case.<br /><br />So there is frustration in trying to gauge my actual fitness levels using this scale - though it does appear to run a true and accurate body weight. Additionally, while the body age feature was an attractive lure for motivating me to get back to High School fitness level it would appear to have the opposite effect and rather than getting fitted for my High School Letterman Jacket had me thinking of getting fitted for dentures and depends!"
5,"Love the scent of this product. We put them all around our house and they smell fantastic. Not overpowering, just perfect."
1,If this oil really was organic it would have the USDA organic label. This looks to be a marketing gimmick. Always look for USDA organic certification.
4,Once again the Ameal BP capsules were smelly! They should ship only a fresh product! Does anyone from Amazon read these reviews!
4,Love this product! It definitely keeps you energized throughout the day..I made sure to drink the recommended amount of water and followed the directions exactly.. I'm starting to see some progress in my fat loss.. I didn't feel any jitters or side effects.. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a jump start with their fat loss!
5,it tastes like a plant should and doesn't hurt my digestive system like other brands do. it seems to work just fine for me.
3,"This product seems to work well but it's just way to short. I am a little over five foot tall and it really falls short of of getting above by shoulder blades. I have owned about six various massagers. I liked this one because it was not quite as loud and it didn't hurts my back. But I wouldn't buy it again because it does not do a really good job . It completely does nothing for upper back, top of shoulders or neck."
5,These pills are great! They give that extra boost i need. Im able to be productive and get stuff done. It also keeps me motivated to workout when i get home from a long day at work!
3,"I had to return it. The knobby side of it has a white chalky substance in it, I guess to keep it from squeaking as you roll it (the smooth side didn't have this stuff and it did squeak a bit)...every time I used it, it would deposit white powder all over me. I was using it on my neck the first time and was surprised to find white powder in my hair and all over the back of my shirt! The next few times, I used a scrap from an old t-shirt to collect the powder, but the roller would get caught up in the fabric. I emailed the seller to ask them about it and Amazon told me to return it as defective. I wanted to get a replacement but couldn't get an answer as to whether it would do this again. Definitely disappointed as it really calmed down a super-tight tendon in my neck. I'm now shopping for another one."
5,This is a great chair. Strong and comfortable and safe! I feel good knowing my family uses this chair and they are safe.
4,Very nice. I purchased to use at work to remind me about my posture. Works well.
5,"It was exactly what I needed, it gave our old cedar trunk that fresh cedar smell back."
5,Feeling better all ready !! Great product !!
3,"I was excited to get these drops, but when they came in I saw that nowhere in the box or bottle does it say HCG. So I don't know if they are real or fake. I read online that if you pay less than $80 for a bottle claiming that it's HCG then their probably fake and what your taking is a water and alcohol which would suck because these drops do taste like alcohol. I don't know if their real or not im just rating them a 3 because my drops came in and I'm hoping that their real."
5,"It's a big bottle. So it's a pretty good deal. It is a little thinner than I am used to. I've been using it on a newborn though and it seems more than gentle enough. ----update-------------------------- I just changed my review to 5 stars after reading Jenny M.'s comment on my original review. Duh! I guess I should have figured that out. It says \\""foaming\\"" on it. I put it in an empty foaming dispenser and it comes out as foam. Wow! what a deal. I will definitely purchase this product again."
4,"I am in search of the ideal elbow sleeve to relieve the pain of cubital tunnel syndrome. When the sleeves provided by my physical therapist came up short when it came to pain relief, I decided to try this sleeve. So, here goes with what I like about this sleeve: - It is sturdy. - Generous gel padding helps protect the ulnar nerve from being aggravated and causing the pain. - Sleeve fits snugly and doesn't move around on the elbow. - Sleeve fabric quickly adjusts its fit to your arm instead of forcing your arm to adjust to it. - Offered in a nice, blue color along with beige. Now for the nits to pick: - It is pricey (but what cost is too much if it does the job well?) - Make sure you select the right size! The way Bort Medical sleeves, braces, and other devices are listed in Amazon does not include a size selection from within one web page. You have sift through all of the Bort Medical items available on Amazon (17 pages of information according to my searches) to find the product you want with the size indicated in its Amazon listing title. - Develops a funky smell after one day of use. It can be hand washed, but washing it once a day and letting it air dry isn't convenient."
5,"We just got these in, they were packaged nicely and all of them we ordered (3) work well. We'll see how long they last, but I know they typically are the best!"
5,Love the smell of Rosemary. It keeps me focus and alerts. Thank you
5,"Works so well! I have extremely thin hair and i used to not even have to brush or comb it but some horrible hairdresser botched my hair and gave me unmanagable layers that would knot so easily and I could find nothing to detangle my hair.<br /><br />I am so happy to finally find a detanger that is just that, I don't want a serum or a mousse or a shampoo, I want a take my hair out of my towel, spray, and comb through easily, and that't what it is. I am so happy"
1,"These are worthless. They are thin and you can't get just one out at a time. Plus, there is hardly any moisture in them."
5,Great product
2,"First of all, it is really fun using this scale! You never know what it will show next. You might loose 5-10 kg within seconds. Everyone using weight watcher programs and such should buy this product! Satisfaction guaranteed.<br /><br />However, if you want an exact measurement of your weight, you should buy a different product. I was stepping on the scale 5 times and I got five different weights within a 15 kg range. Also, trying the scale on different floor materials still initiated the random number generator.<br /><br />Luckily, Amazon took it back for a full refund. I would never buy it again."
1,Batteries dont last long
5,I love the energy this gives me. I also love that it is plant based. Gives you drive to accomplish things when you are feeling tired. Last all day!<br />I received a discount for this item and I do recommend it.
5,"A great product and a great value all around, especially at the subscribe and save price. Would buy again. Like having lots so i never run out."
5,Good if not best oils!
5,love this stuff...and great price!
5,"Good price for product.. Suprised on potency, have had stronger preworkouts but this is a good one to cycle into your program"
1,"Internal rechargeable battery was defective. After following the directions for charging the unit, we tried using it. The unit would not hold the charge. Tried several more charges, but would only say on when it was connected to the charger. We specifically purchased it for a cruise at the end of this month after seeing in Sky Mall. Luckily we tested it out again before we took it on our cruise. It may have just been a \\""lemon\\"", however, for the price of $159, I would expect the unit to work properly. Very disappointed."
5,I've been taking the Epiq Test for a few weeks now. I don't start the Epiq Hardening until after taking the Test for 30 days. I feel stronger than ever right now. My PR's are constantly going up! Can't wait to finish the stack to see how high my PR's can reach!!
5,This feels great. I've only used it for 1 month and my back feels smoother and less itchy. My husband has his own and it helps with his back breakouts:) Easier then trying to apply bath sugar all over your back.
4,"Package came super fast. The protein taste OK. Not the best in flavor, but it delivers the protein quick. It's tolerable. I pretty much just drink it like chocolate milk with my almond milk. I haven't tried it in a smoothie yet."
5,"Arrived on time, seal intact."
5,"This is a product that I've not been able to find in stores. It's an excellent wound care gel, very healing and cool to the skin. I've used it in a hospital setting when I was admitted and loved it. The service was excellent and time taken for delivery was superior."
5,Another great product from Bulk Supplements. Why pay more for fancy packaging that you only throw away. will definitely be a future repeat customer.
5,I have been drinking this product for years. It is smooth tasting and gets you going for a great workout.
5,"I would definately buy again, very nice for the holidays"
4,just fine
5,works as advertised
4,"I picked this up as I wanted to get a good quality brush that wasn't synthetic or boar's hair. The brush is quite soft and well constructed. The stand is a simple piece of plastic, but it does the job. I have only used it once so far, but made sure to give it a good wash and condition and rinse before using. So far so good. No loose hairs, no &#34;smell&#34;, looks great, works well."
3,"The hand grips are more comfortable than the under arm pads because they are too bulky which was throwing off my balance. The dogs, however, love tossing them in the air, so it's a win-win. The pink color is a bright and happy."
5,Awesome product!
5,These are the best-priced cloth menstrual pads that I have found. And I am very happy with the quality and workmanship. These are the first cloth pads that I have purchased so I don't have any other brands to compare them to. I am very pleased though.
3,This bowl worked for me until I couldn't get it to stop leaking under the bowl where the hose meets the sink. It may just be mine but other than that I still use it and it does the job. I would recommend you get a nice size cute bucket to drain if you have customers.
5,Worked great
5,"Excellent quality, will buy from again, thank you so much!!!"
5,a little goes a long way!! gives a lot of volume.. And saves me the time of washing my hair for an extra day ...
3,Based on reviews I knew the massage aspect of this product wasn't worth it but I do like the way it fits into my back and for that reason I would recommend it.
4,zzZZZZZzzz... Huh?
5,This product is amazing! I have heard great things about it and I have not been disappointed. I have lost over 20 pounds and I am still going. I have much more energy. My hunger is under control and I feel great. It really suppresses your appetite. I would highly recommend this product to everyone.
5,"Does what it says, batteries lasted a year before needing changing after being used 2-3 times a day. Speaks louldy enough to be heard across the house, making it great for caretakers who can't get the person to tell them what it said :)"
2,"Ok..so I had my sister purchased this hair in 12\\"" 1b which was pretty long for 12\\""...loved that about it...and I installed (sew in)it unto her head giving her a centre path n sum kim kardashian frontal sweeps....pple...let me tell u this...am no proffessional or nothing I just know my stuff....and this hair was phenominal when I installed it...looked bouncy n flowy n all so natural for. Like a week....but after that...the hair got so stiff!!! It had me thinking if it exhudes spritz r something...n it sheds like a dog loosing hair!!! It was a nightmare I tell u....and u see in that one week period it did not keep not 1 curl!!...@ the first installment when I curled it I noticed it kinda frindges if the flat iron was too hot so I had 2 turn it down...but I wasn't really expecting anything bigger because its NOT FULLY HUMAN....its premium mixed meaning its got synthetic n a lil human strands mixed somwhere in there....I don't know where.....but its somehwere there.....so as I was saying earlier on...this is a OK hair if you wanna just wear it 4 like a week NOT MORE!!!! Idk if. Its the climate here in Jamaica or what but trust me the result wasn't so good....and with curling the hair u have 2 keep it set while its hot so the curl doesn't fall...but after a time the curls will be lost...doesn't last for long...and another thing...I tried washing the hair and it was even worse it got more coarse....it was just a nightmare pple....as I saw in a nother review the only way this hair looked good after a week r so is in a bun in a ponytail...so finnaly if your looking for a hair that's gonna last SHE is not it...looking sumn cheap that not entirely human....but better than she try Kima classic or Reba thos were good hair or u could even use Yaki Express you Won't regret it trust me....I hope my review helped someone XoXo hugz&Kisses"
3,"I purchased this product last spring to help de-tangle my toddler's hair. Back then, she was only 14 months old and still had short (but curly) hair. Even then, this didn't really help us comb out the tangles in her hair. It DID help define her curls once her hair was already combed, plus it did add shine - which was nice. I followed the directions on the bottle and used this when her hair was still wet. I also tried using a conditioner first and also tried using this when her hair was dry. It still didn't help de-tangle.<br /><br /> Now that she's 22 months old, she has hair that goes almost down to her shoulders when it's wet. Her hair is fine and she has lots of tight Little Orphan Annie curls. With her hair now being longer, this stuff no longer does anything for it at all. In fact, I'd say that it even dries her hair out. After using this, her hair turns into a frizzy mess in a matter of hours. Her hair seriously looks better WITHOUT this product in it.<br /><br /> I do love that the ingredients are safe and this stuff also smells fabulous. The bottle lasts a long time. I really do wish it would work. However, I've now switched over to using California Baby Calendula Conditioner in her hair to help tame it - and that does work wonderfully - but I'm still hoping to find a natural de-tangler that actually does what it's supposed to do.<br /><br />* (I use Earth Mama Angel Baby or California Baby shampoos on my baby. I use either Healthy Times or California Baby conditioner. I have very soft water and only wash my baby's hair a couple times per week. The only reason I mention this is to point out that my baby's hair care routine isn't overly harsh, so it shouldn't be making this product ineffective.)"
1,I was using this product for more than 3 weeks with exercises and I checked my weigh today and I found I gained 3 more lbs. I am sure this is a fake product from what Dr. Oz's and i wanna claim my money back.
5,Easy to use. Got these during an extended work trip. Worked well and my cloths came out clean and fresh smelling.
5,easy to install and simple to use. and arrived a day early
1,"I'm surprised about the number of recommendations I received for this product. People said it was a miracle for their teething toddlers but these did nothing for my fussy teether, and brought no relief at all."
5,"I am very happy with this product! Cups are of a good quality, and suction power you can adjust as you prefer. The massage is very relaxing and pleasant. I also use them to get asleep every night. My husband places them on my upper back for 10 min, and I immediately fall asleep...Great experience! Thank you! I keep advertising this to all my friends. Highly recommend!"
5,Seems to be good quality. I have no experience to back that up other then using mag calm. This does not dissolve in water as quickly so I have made pills to take. Thanks Bulksupplements. Always a pleasure to deal with.
3,"This stuff is ok. It looks good after you initially do it, but after a day it's almost like your nails get polished up and look shiny again, but not shiny enough that it looks like it should be that way."
5,This was a repeat purchase of an overall good product. We will make it our first for paper products. We hope that this item will always be available in the future
5,This product is awesome & the price is great. Got it in time with not too much wait.
4,These brushes are so much better thank synthetic ones .We have used them for several years now . I prefer them over sponges and wash clothes. The last one we ordered however I was less pleased with .The metal band connecting the wooden handle with the brush came loose . I made repeate attempts to get it back on and have failed .. Thus I will not give it a 5 star..
4,"a little difficult to put together, but it works for me"
5,I couldn't wait to clean all my sweaters and pack them away in my cedar chest..... I was really tired of Winter!!
5,Leave on for 2 hours and wait for about a week and enjoy the fun of peeling off the old nasty skin that just falls off. Works great without any weird reactions.
5,Buy this! It's great!
1,"Nothing more then caffine , curves appitite about it , glad i had samples not worth it !!"
5,10 stars
2,This product did not work towards providing me with any extra energy. I was just as tired as I was before I started taking it.
5,I am very pleased with Snowy Bleach.. I looked high and low for this product to no avail and finally found it through Amazon. Thank you so much. I love how it brightens my color clothes and and whitens my undies
1,These are the cheapest pieces of s'crap you will ever see. They are barely sticky thin pads that don't connect well at all to any nose piece. WASTE OF MONEY
5,"Item as described, loved it...."
2,Did not like it couldn't drink. The taste is not pleasant. So I just didn't bother with them.
5,"&#34;My wife wears flip-flops constantly and was spending a lot of our money on spa treatments for her feet or tearing her feet apart with the manual pumice stone. So, I decided to buy Pedi.Cure for my wife to try it out in hopes that maybe she could use it every once in awhile to supplement the spa visits. After one use, she was hooked! She would not stop talking about how great it made her feet feel and how happy she was that I bought it for her Which was good for me! She kept insisting that I needed to try it because I was having pain in my feet from running. Finally, I gave in and tried Pedi.Cure. I cannot tell you how happy I am with this purchase! I am ordering another one just so I can have my own because my feet are nasty. I will say, if you use too much pressure, it will not work as well. You need to lightly run the roller over the problem areas on your foot repeatedly and it will gently smooth out all dead and callused skin. My wife and I used the Pedi.Cure so much that we needed to order eoller heads which arrived within days and were just as good as the first. Additionally, the customer service from the company was great. They answered all of my questions with their emails and I am a satisfied customer. One of the best Amazon purchases I have made!!"
5,Sister with dementia uses this with no problem. Glad to have it. Hand washes easily - I don't put it in the dishwasher due to the slip-resistant bottom.
5,"I have used this Quercetin Plus Nettle for several years, and it is the best product I have found to take care of itchy eyes, and runny nose during allergy season. A great help."
3,"I tried this supplement for a three weeks and it seemed to do OK but nothing spectacular. In all fairness, I seem to respond to powders and liquid drinks far better than capsules."
5,Good size and works well. Cant complain. You will be pleased with this product. Would be nice if came in different colors.
1,"The package was lost in my building by the manager and was not found until after my event was over. I requested to return the item because it was no longer needed, however Vert Delivery would not take the unused, unopened item back. They said:<br /><br />&#34;Due the personal nature of the products we sell, ALL SALES ARE FINAL.  We are unable to return or exchange purchased toys and/or novelty products. This is for the health, safety and peace of mind of our customers.<br /><br />Once these items leave our warehouse, they are considered used, and therefore cannot be returned.&#34;<br /><br />I had no idea their return policy differed from Amazon's. So since I am now stuck with this banner, I opened the package and found that it is much shorter and the letters are much smaller than anticipated. I would not recommend purchasing this ite"
4,"I can think of several better brands then the Body Fortress brand (EAS, BSN, MuscleTech etc...) but Body Fortress is probably the best bet if you're on a budget and can't afford the high price tags of the bigger brands that are out there. Cookies N Cream is easily the best flavor for this particular brand, which isn't saying much because the rest of the flavors a completely horrid. However, to this flavors credit, it does taste a little bit like the flavor that's labeled on the container.<br /><br />Despite what many people might think because of its price tag, Body Fortress is a high quality protein source and the fact that its Whey products are 52-60 grams of protein every two scoops is really impressive. The only problem that has plagued this product, is once again, the taste. This is really the only flavor from their Whey Protein Powder line that is actually somewhat easy to chug down, because the regular Chocolate, Strawberry, Vanilla and the awful Chocolate and Peanut Butter are not.<br /><br />So overall, this is the only flavor that gets a passing grade from me."
3,"I bought this from Amazon-Marketplacer \\""Perfect Beauty\\"".<br /><br />It seems to be just a pure badger brush whose tips have been bleached, NOT a brush with silver tip badger hair.<br /><br />The box it comes in says \\""100% Pure Badger Shaving-Brush\\"".<br /><br />You can check omegabrush.com (Italian site) and it says nothing about this model having silver tip badger hair.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I also would not recommend buying from Perfect Beauty unless you wish to wait 2+ weeks for your product."
4,"My brother bought this for his ex, because she was always cold, but there's just not really a good place to keep something like this."
5,This is exactly what I have been taking for several years. Much better price and I will be ordering more as needed.
3,"Definitely did not taste like Cookies and Cream, but it isn't that bad. It's better warmed. Also, this thing is extremely dense, so despite it being small-ish (at least compared to the same company's cookies), it IS rich and may even be too much for some people. The brownie itself also is not too sweet, which I like."
1,"Thought that I was making the right choice by buying these diapers...wrong idea. My baby's skin broke out with a reddened groin/buttocks area within 3 days of usage. I knew that these diapers were the culprit because I had not made any other changes to his natural care routine (organic foods, creams, lotions, etc). Narrowing it down to these \\""free and clear\\"" diapers made me trash the rest of the unused portion. Will not make that mistake again! The area of the diaper that came in contact with my baby's lower abdomen skin broke out into a bit of a rash. Love Seventh Generation's dish liquid and laundry detergent but will never venture out to get any diapers by this brand. Very disappointed considering that this company prides themselves on being natural and safe. I will stay on the safe side and continue buying Huggie's Naturals and Kroger's chlorine free diapers..both have never upset my precious baby's sensitive skin!"
5,Every emergency kit should contain enough iOSAT for every member of the household. They're packaged well and have a fairly long expiration before they need to be replaced.
2,"I did not like this product. It is so cheaply made and not at all durable. It ripped and pulled loose at the seams in two other places on the first use. I did have it filled but, it wasn't filled ridiculously heavy or anything. I expect a backpack to hold a lot, especially one advertised as extra large for travel and shopping. If you plan to use this backpack for anything potentially substantial, I wouldn't waste your money on this buy. Good luck!"
5,Works Great... just like a gym dust mop...
5,"Top notch aminos from BulkSupplements. Yes, the taste is not great as with all aminos. Aminos are the future and I was buying the tablets from Twinlab, which is a very good brand. But the Bulk is great quality at an infinitely better price.<br /><br />Keep up the good work Bulk. I hope you continue to produce quality at fair price."
5,"I've only had my scale for about a week, but I really like it! It is simple, easy to read, and easy to use. I purchased this scale after reading a number of reviews. It seems that over time, the scales I've had aren't accurate any longer. EatSmart advertised their scale as staying accurate which is the main reason I purchased it."
5,great price and great product
1,Doesn't work.<br />Awaiting my refund.<br />Followed instructions but no mist/colors changing just a waste of my time and money!
2,My mistake for not paying much attention to the ingredients!
5,"There are so many fuel options for runners, but GU has the best taste and goes down easy. It's easy to digest, too. Highly recommend this."
5,Perfect for my usage.
5,"I have been a fan of this drink ever since i was given a can at a motorcross in 2003 event in murray ky,i use to have to drive 40+ miles to get it so i usually bought two cases a month,in 04 i moved to galveston island texas and could not find the drink there,after a web search and much pleading i started buying direct,the shipping was high but i did not care,after about 1 1/2 years i was directed to go to Amazon to order.my first order did arrive with a coulple of empty cans due to poor packing but again i did not care,then came the day i ordered and was told the item was on backorder.not a problem as i had some reserve stock but i did quit sharing with others at the bar i managed.thinking i would get the chance to order soon but to my sadness i learned that DC brands in its infinate wisdom had discontinued the product.i contacted DC brands and was told this was true,asking if anyone had any unsold product i was told one dist. had a pallet but would not break it for case sale.as i was trying to figure out where i could come up with the money to buy a whole pallet and where i would store it if i did,the rep from DC brands e-mailed me saying the pallet had been returned and would break it for case sale.i bought all i could manage to afford (10 cases) now i see Amazon has some so i will be buying what i can get here.I can't believe that DC brands discontinued this product.how dumb is that. Dickens Cider is the best drink i have ever found if served ice cold as it recomends,i was raised drinking \\""hard cider\\"" and it reminds me exactly of that.no after taste and no jitters if you don't drink more than 2 cans in 24 hours.as a club manager i put in 12-16 hr days at times,all my staff knew that at 11pm i would be comming behind the bar to get my can for the night,this allowed me to run the club till 2 am,close,oversee restocking and close out.by the time i got home at around 4 am i was able to shower and get a good nights rest.WHY WOULD DC BRANDS STOP OFFERING THIS WONDERDRINK?"
5,great prices
5,"Wonderful product, will definitely purchase again from this seller. I was in search of Turmeric including ingredients for maximum absorption. After doing research, and reading about ingredients needed for maximum absorption and full benefits from the product, this seller had everything I was looking for. Easy on the stomach, easy to swallow, and after only a few days, energy is up!"
5,Love all the products in this!!
4,Great product
5,"I bought this belt at 15 weeks pregnant and at this point, I'm almost 22 weeks. So far so good. I run 2.5 miles a day, 5-6 days a week. I always wear it over a shirt so it doesn't rub against my skin. I feel very safe and comfortable when wearing it and wouldn't run without it. I would definitely purchase again."
5,I love Nellie's Laundry Nuggets! Several members in our family have sensitive skin and Nellie's is okay for all of us. It works well on toddler clothes as well. Surprisingly so! I've put things in the washer thinking that with liquid soap I would always pre-treat a stain. Not needed so far - all our clothes come out clean and stain free.<br /><br />One user commented on the nuggets being hard. That is true for me as well. I put a nut cracker in the box of nuggets and just crunch up each nugget before I use it. It may not be a problem for machines where you add soap with the clothes. I use a front loader with a dispenser and we have had hardened chunks that did not completely dissolve. I'm able to crunch the nuggets with the nutcracker and it doesn't burst the outer pack. Just a few squeezes and the hardened nuggets are ready to use and dissolve easily with nothing leftover.
5,I used this to store one man's XML ski jacket along with three other jackets. After using getting the air out I realized I could have put more in. Amazon Prime delivered it to me in two days with a good price.
5,tyyyyyyyyyyy
4,I use L-Carnitine in support of an exercise and weight loss effort. After researching TwinLabs I felt comfortable ordering from them and have been pleased with that choice.
5,Used these batteries to replace exhausted batteries that shipped with mini-lights that we used during power outage of hurricane Sandy. Work great!
4,"Seals out the dark, but does let a little light in underneath. However, it doesn't press down on the eyelids and is very comfortable. Also, stays on all night and doesn't seem to twist around like some of the cheaper masks do. Very good quality."
5,"An absolute necessity for the 32-33.8 bottles of shampoo and/or conditioner. Bought 32 oz bottles, so am happy that they work for them as well as the 33.8 oz."
5,These insoles make all the difference. This is my second pair and I can't imagine running without them. I am loyal to Nike running shoes and these insoles provide the perfect support.
4,"Works great when doing normal tasks, but if you put it in your pocket and ride an ATV on rough road if falsely registers steps."
4,"I thought i would be able to use them with my shoes, that is when bunnion hurts<br />But they are thick for that purpose and shoe wont fit.<br />Otherwise, if i use them around the house, it kind of sooths my bunnion"
5,"I like this when I use my computer, now and them Keeps circulation going. My Dr recommended this."
5,I wanted a band-aid = I needed these.<br />I wanted a tin = I needed a funny bandage<br />I need to post 8 more words in this review.
5,"Such a great product. The wipes are compostable and the packaging is plastic free. If you are a \\""green\\"" family, these are the wipes for you. With the subscribe and save program they are SO cost effective, cheaper than a department store!"
5,"Just couldn't live without this when recovering from surgery. BUT, now that I'm better i still use it for myriad things since I'm rather height challenged. Very sturdy."
5,They are AAA batteries
5,Love this stuff.
5,"How is it that I get more information about products from Amazon then many other places? So glad I switched to this product. I was using another product that recently changed and has been &#34; reformatted&#34;. I had noticed a difference when the other DIM I was taking had changed their formula a bit, but thought I was just more stressed etc. I began feeling more emotionally even once I started Smokey Mtn DIM and I no longer have night sweats."
5,This stuff is really fragrant. I like the way it smells (like cinnamon and firewood and honey) but your beard will smell like a candle.
5,"I always forgot to take my multi-vitamin pills in the morning with breakfast. Now, I don't because they taste so good! Awesome product. My physician thought they were great too."
5,"Smells amazing. Used it before shaving which isn't recommended because it leaves a bit of a waxy feel on your skin. I could tell it was effective and moisturizing on my arms and body with application. Used lotion after as an added bonus, however it hydrated my skin enough. Would definitely purchase again."
1,"I bought this for my terrible jaw clenching. I followed the instructions, and simply bit through it - with the filling liquid in my mouth.<br />the sad thing is that I ordered also the bigger size - and same thing happened.<br /><br />Avoid this one."
5,"This turmeric is wonderful! Turmeric is an anti inflammatory and I now taking it instead of an ASAID. I use turmeric in cooking,but for good results I feel the need to supplement because I can't add turmeric to all our food! I take it 2 or 3 times a day with meals. I have mild arthritis in my knees and I know this is helping."
4,Got em today. Wearing one ball at the moment. It was a little hard getting it in. But it definitely makes u work to keep it in. Try it!
5,"This thing really works well. We have a neighbor we call &#34;Loud Howard&#34; after a certain cartoon character, who is an older hearing impaired guy that communicates by shouting. It's just his way. Anyhow, we're sleeping much better with this device."
5,Use these on my Santa Medical LFM-110. Work perfectly. The adhesive is great and the performance is just like the ones that came with the unit.
5,This massager is one of the better I've used. The only issue I've found is the heat option doesn't seem to be very warm. Little warmer would be great. Overall does exactly what I want.
1,"As said in the title, this product lists oils, leaf extracts and vitamins in it's ingredients. The fancy ingredient list looks great except for the \\""Essential Oil of Mentha Viridis Leaf.\\"" Products that are applied to the skin or lips that include anything \\""mentha\\"" or \\""menthol\\"" is a huge turn-off for me and ruins the whole product. This type of ingredient is irritating to the skin. I get frustrated whenever vendors include menthol-type ingredients in their products. They should know better than that! Trying to draw customers in to the \\""cooling\\"" sensation is bogus! I can't return this, because I opened it before reading the ingredients. Waste of $1.65 - ugh"
5,These are 20 miu of hcg sensitivity. First Response claims to be 15 miu. So these are pretty good. Also no evap lines. I confirmed with a first response after my positive result and these were correct.
5,Love it. Use it daily. Relieves back stress and neck issues.
5,This is a great product. I like to software that comes with the device. You can export the software into a spreadsheet and track every step. Much easier than having to write it down. The machine is very easy to use. Spend the extra $$ and get this device with the software. You will be glad you did.
5,My husbands favorite insoles!!
5,Works great and a good value.
4,I've been lifting for over a year now and finally decided to add a shake into my diet. I'm about 3/4 of the way through my tub & have seen AWESOME results so far. Really taken my recovery & gains to the next level.<br /><br />However it tastes like Sweet & Low flavored chocolate. I started masking that flavor blending a banana or strawberries with.
4,Seems to be working
5,Just what I expected...
5,Great product. Easy open package . Excellent price compared to other products of the same
5,Great Deal! Great product! Exactly what was expected. Thanks!
5,I've used Optimum for years and find it's the perfect balance of protein content and bearable taste. This stuff tastes great in any blend
5,I have the Fitbit Charge and my son wanted to count his steps too. I didn't want to fork over alot of money for something that he would more than likely lose. I felt comfortable with the reviews on this item and the price was perfect for an active 11-year old. He set it up no problems and enjoys looking at his step count as he challenges me every day. He loves the fact it saves his count for the week. He doesn't use the clip provided he just puts it in his pocket and it was a perfect counter for him. We are both happy with the purchase.
5,"I bought this product for my friend. Before taking the pills, she slept 2-3 hrs/night. Thanks to the passion flower standardized, now she can sleep straight from 9 pm to 5 am. My neighbor also tried it and her sleeping pattern has been improved."
5,"Had this on auto- delivery for my Husband with gout. Had to switch to another brand for auto-delivery, but we were very happy with this. If he did have a gout attack, it would be much more mild, when before, it was debilitating."
5,The product keeps my weight low and it is easy to swallow. I have already dropped 6lbs in just two weeks
5,"I like that I can now borrow my daughter's Amope. I bought her one for Christmas and she's used it every week since. It works really well but as any grinding/filing surface, it smoothed out with use. These are nice and fresh and since they come in a two-pack, I can have my own."
5,I purchased this walker for my mother. She has gotten numerous complements on her walker. It is absolutely WONDERFUL. By retracting the walker she can maneuver thru small spaces then once passed can simply expand to full size. No other walker can do this!! It is fast and light for me to get into the car. A definite win-win for the patient and caregiver. I highly recommend this walker. It is worth every penny.
5,The item works very we
5,The product was everything it claimed.<br />I especially like the folding capability and easy storage.<br />It also Easily changed from extended to folded configurations.
4,"It works great, but after a few months, the bubbles over the eyes get flatter. I bought this because regular face masks press against my eyes and its very irritating. And like I said, it was great for a couple months but after that it went flat :/."
4,I got a bunch of weird stuff in my package. Vegan or nutrition nut crud. But the butter was as expected. Seems of good quality.
5,Perfect for my foot and they last long.
4,"I am at the end of this cycle of NOX 3. I used the Pinnacle NOX 2 years ago and it seems as though the Pinnacle product worked better. Now, I will do another cycle of the Universal NOX 3 to ensure that product is truly in my system. My diet has been extremely clean. No junk food what so ever and no eating out. I will see if there will be any changes with the next cycle."
1,It only worked for 2 wks. It was noisy and does not have a timer. Spend your money on a better quality unit. I do not recommend this product.
5,Amazing product can't wait to start losing weight! Thank you
5,I got a deal on these! I love them. They are actually better than the huggies brand because they are more affordable and they work just as good. The packaging is cute as well. I will definitely buy more of these once in out.
5,Good for arthritis
5,"Love this product. Have used it for about 2 months and have lost about 6 pounds, which is very good for me."
4,The sheets are convenient and easy to use. You don't need remember to bring a bottle of laundry detergent and softener sheets to the laundromat. Cleans clothes quite well. Too bad they discontinued the product.
3,"The product itself is good, the orange flavor, not so much."
5,"I've purchased this several times and it works great for my son that has trouble digesting milk but loves drinking chocolate milk! It saves a bundle since I don't have to buy \\""special\\"" milk. Happy with this purchase."
5,"I absolutely love this product. I exercise regularly and have been watching my diet, but since I have added this product I have lost 8 lbs and I am feeling really great, my energy level is so much better and my appetite has decreased (that's always a good thing). I turn 50 next month and with that are so many changes to my body, and my metabolism as well as my energy level. I really feel that this garcinia cambogia is the way to go to help increase the positive experience of losing weight and feeling great doing. I highly recommend this product. No jitters, no highs or lows, nice and steady all day."
5,Good job. Thx
5,"My wife suffers from Fibromyalgia and this stuff is liquid gold! It doesn't take away her pain, but it can calm things down enough for her to get much needed rest!"
5,Changed my daughter's sleeping. Love this product
5,"With so much power, the wife can only use it for about a minute max. Instant climax if you use this product. It does get warm if left on for a long period and the head is on the firmer side for use, but other than that it;s a great product."
5,Love these.
5,"Very good for the price,<br /><br />Didnt even try the penis plug though to thick and stainless steel isnt a good pickfor that .<br /><br />Cons, its on the heavy side likes to slide down abit."
4,I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. This was the little help I needed to help me fall asleep faster at night because sometimes I struggle. I did enjoy the peach flavor better but they get the job done.
5,After six days it seems to work fine. Delivery was about ten days faster than was estimated. If it continues to seem good I will reorder.
4,"The Nature Made Fish Oil 1000mg Liquid Softgels, 250-count is a good value. It is 1000mg with 300mg of Omega 3. 2 soft gels taken with a meal provide the recommended daily amount of 600mg of Omega-3 - including 500mg of EPA and DHA. The recommended daily serving is the equivalent of 2 servings of fatty fish. There is no color added, no artificial flavors or preservatives and is gluten free. Ingredients included however are gelatin, glycerin, water and tocopherol (vitamin E). There is a note that it contains fish (anchovy and sardine) as well as soy. The fish country of origin is Peru but it claims to be manufactured and tested in the USA.The expiration date on the bottle I received is 3 years out and expires January 2018. They are easy to take and have no after taste. Too soon to know if it produces results or not, but I can update my review in 6 months when I know for sure whether or not they are effective."
5,LOVE
2,Did nothing for me but everyone is different.
2,Overwhelming scent. It gave me a headache. So if you are sensitive to scents this probably isn't for you.
5,Lubricant works great!
5,Great Product!
5,NOW has very good products at reasonable pricing!
5,"I happen to like this kind of tea anyway but when I found out I was getting in the pre hypertensive range, (I'm very healthy in my habits but have some b/p issues in my family and I'm pushing 60 ), so I went on the hunt for natural products that lower blood pressure and found this was one of them (along with other things like dark or raw chocolate, red wine, and garlic).<br /><br />I've been drinking this almost daily for a couple weeks now and sure enough my bp has come down a few points! Of course the garlic and raw cacao may be helping too (don't drink much red wine), but this may well be helping."
5,The Mommy-to-be loved it & loved the scent of the soap. The little lamb was very cute too. I found this stuff in a magazine & could only find it on Amazon.
3,"I've only tried it once thus far, and the only issue is I'm not accustomed to sweetness in this type of product. Perhaps I will get used to it over time. All else is good. Thank You"
3,I actually didn't order this item at any time this year but I have bought them in the past. They work as advertised and when you need to have that 'extra' protection for your bed this can be a perfect solution.
4,"It is somewhat uncomfortable sleeping on your side with it. It is very comfortable when sleeping on one's back however. I don't use it every night, and sometimes I take it out halfway through the night. Maybe one could become accustomed to it over time."
5,Perfect for giving medicine to my 92 year old mother. No more dropped pills
1,"Any homeopathic product doesn't contain any actual active ingredient. &#34;6x&#34; is so dilute that there's almost no chance that a single molecule of any of the ingredients listed on the package is actually in there. Not only is this a placebo, but it's a placebo for the parents only - the baby has no clue. Check out the wikipedia article about homeopathic dilution. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathic_dilutions"
5,taste and works great. the best tasting shock therapy in my opinion. wish it came in the 2 lb size
5,I wasn't too sure about this new form of fiber (for me anyway). YUMMY! I put them in overnight Oatmeal!! I have a recipe for &#34;tapioca pudding&#34; made with these beauties. Can't wait to try!
5,"Bought for an ex girlfriend, and she was so pleased with both the beauty and the quality of this product that she raved about it clear until we broke up!!!"
1,"PLEASE do not ingest this stuff! Go ahead and use it topically or in your laundry or whatever, but for the love of Pete, don't take it orally. If you think that this is a &#34;natural&#34; disinfectant or anti-fungal, you are wrong. Unfortunately grapefruit seeds do not have natural antimicrobial properties.<br /><br />The FDA and DEA have issued MANY warnings to the manufacturers of &#34;Citricidal&#34; in the last few years because these products are heavily contaminated with benzalkonium chloride. What exactly is this chemical? Well you may already know it as HAND SANITIZER.<br /><br />I can't speak for the purity of liquid extracts, but the powders are most heavily contaminated. Please read the industry trade article below:<br /><br />http://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Suppliers2/Expert-dismisses-grapefruit-seed-extract-false-positive-explanation<br /><br />TL;DR - one of the manufacturers stated that Citricidal is the same molecular weight as BZK, giving a false positive test result. This is total BS, as explained by one of the nation's top chemists, director of Flora Labs, James Neal-Kababick. This guy is a consumer advocacy crusader who does this for a living:<br /><br />http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19230748/ns/health-health_care/t/bogus-ingredients-put-consumers-health-risk/#.VWzlIM5vb0c<br /><br />They've even found TRICLOSAN in these powders...that's the disinfectant in your anti-bacterial soaps. So PLEASE do not consume this, and understand the only reason it kills your athlete's foot or yeast infection is because it has artificial sanitizers illegally and unethically added to it."
5,"Been using Bono, but I think I may have found a preferred product here. Left a nicer shine than Bono. Will continue to use to make sure it keeps up my first impression."
5,"I have gave this to one of the men, being that they work out and they told me when they started taking it they started seeing results within a few days. it have gave them more energy and to help build more muscle mass. It will also help the man boost his sex drive. he also told me experienced no side effects from taking this product."
5,Wow! They work!
5,My health escalated. I replaced ambrotose with Verapol and source naturals larch to save money. That enabled me to increase my dosage. And my health improved significantly. Even without gum ghatti which is also in ambrotose.
5,Great product
4,"Nice mild herbal laxative. My mom used it for years and was pretty happy. Now I started taking it as needed. There is no magic pill, so what we need just exercise and eat properly, but when we facing a problem, Senade can help. Take one or two pills before going to bed. Made in India."
5,this hairpiece was big enough to see. this was a gift for someone and it looked amazing on her.
5,This stuff works!
5,"I love these vitamins. I can't seem to find them at any other store. Rite aid, Kmart, Wal-Greens do not carry them. Little disappointed. These vitamins taste so good, easy to digest and make a huge difference on my skin and hair. I would highly recommend these to anyone who wants to improve the softness of their skin and improve hair texture. They really work!"
5,"I've done comparison shopping for this supplement and I'm convinced this product has the best quality of ingredients for the best price. There are very few products with the same ingredient profile, and those in the same category are more expensive. I appreciate the thoughtful consideration given to combining the most effective ingredients to obtain optimal results. I'm looking forward to more products from this vendor."
3,"I wore the original BodyBugg for 7.5 years and just upgraded to the FitBit Flex, I love that I can wear it 24-7 and that it can get wet. I also love that it is lightweight, syncs to my computer or phone without needing to be plugged in and that I can buy different colored bands. Now for the issues; I hate that it puts me into sleep/ activity mode when I clap or during some workouts, I do not like that it is not even close to being accurate on calories burned, I wish there was a HR attachment option. I think a HR FitBit is soon to release, but I already own an expensive pedometer so I clearly won't be upgrading any time soon."
5,"Great, very sturdy stand. Fits a long handle razor."
4,I like this item mostlly and it works for my housecleaning service and saves time and energy.<br />The only drawback is that the scrubber refills do not last very well in a daily use in my business.
5,I had one that was many years old and it finally stopped working. It helps alot with my achy shoulders. I put in on the back of my computer chair and soak in the heat. These are well made and a must have for me.
5,This is a very nice item and well constructed. I would recommend as we have been using for several years now and just moved from one bathroom to another (due to remodeling) and it is still holding up well and looks nice.
5,Great price. A must have for active kids.
4,The HTP helps me sleep better and helps me with balancing my moods. I don't have the extreme highs or lows when I am taking it.
2,"This machine was, for the first 4 months, the greatest thing for me since sliced bread. But then a pivot post inside the machine broke. I never overloaded it but this plastic post broke off. This post keeps the chamber loading hinge pin from getting misaligned. I had to do some major rebuilding in order to get it to work again.<br />After this repair, it continued to function reasonably well for an additional 5 months. However, the spoon injection proximity switch failed a couple of weeks ago. So it goes to the spare parts bin.<br />We made about 50 cartons of cigs before this injector failed. So at 11 cents per pack it may still be a reasonable price price/pack. But there must be something more reliable."
5,Great! Perfect description for the product.
5,If you need to go this is what you need. It works every time. When all else fails this will do the job.
5,"I had a wrist monitor from CVS which was inaccurate. This one seems very accurate and very easy to use/read. Men :), you do need to read the instructions for initial set-up! Not especially intuitive."
5,Awesome products I went from 230lbs. To 175lbs will definitely suggest to anyone that is trying to loose weight.
5,"I got this for my sister who recently started BP meds. She says it works great, no complaints. I have a different kind but will be inclined to get this kind in the future when we need another one."
5,"Fast shipping, Great!"
4,"It seems to be woRking. I take every morning and nites. I haven't noticed any kinds of side effects yet. What I noticed was that I yawn less, mentally focused, and getting up early."
1,"Very disappointed in the Slow FE Slow Release Iron Tablets. I thought if I bought the slow release, it would be easier on my stomach, but it was not. After only one pill, I had several days of discomfort. For me, it was a complete waste of money."
2,Very thick no curve
5,"I love the friction block. Like a lot of women, I tend to wear flats because my feet just can't take heels all the time. That being said, there are discomforts that come with wearing flats as well. Rubbing, blisters etc. I remedy this by always buying my flats one size larger and getting friction block. This stuff is amazing. I put it on before I go out and reapply as needed (which is usually never). I highly recommend for those looking for a bit of relief!"
5,keeps your baby gas free and less fussy. A little on the pricey side but definitely works. will def recommend
5,Great product.
5,"I use this item on my big bottle of mouth wash two pumps in a cup and rinse, much easier than picking up the big bottle and pouring into a cup. [[ASIN:B001M0NFEU Listerine Antiseptic Mouthwash, Cool Mint - 500 ml (Pack of 4)]]"
1,"No, just no. You can be eco friendly and make great products. They have not reached that goal yet. Too thin, paper like, not a conformable experience in-between the cheeks."
5,just as described! Excellent! I have purchased these envelopes twice now and have not been disappointed. They are very good quality and a great price!
5,I got two free quest bars to try and loved both. Have ordered several flavors and loved every one but his is THE BEST.<br />Tastes quite decadent and yet healthy. What a treat
5,Bacitracin is the best for taking case of many wounds. It was recommended by my Dermatologist. Couldn't beat this for a recommendation!!!!!
5,"Very good glasses, they make me look great too (So yay!), nothing negative I'm an average size guy so they fit the average person well. I program with these but use them all day. They do give off a slight yellow tint, but not the &#34; Fake tan&#34; yellow like the man in the picture. If you program these will be great, you can also get different strengths, which would be amazing if you cant c#."
5,"Not sure how much more needs to be said other than I don't have a baby. They work, I've never had one bust, and she likes them."
5,"Rusk Sensories Calm is my absolute favorite conditioner. It smells delicious and I only need to use a little bit to get soft, silky hair even though I have long, thick hair. The conditioner is thinner than ones that I have used in the past, but it works well. It doesn't leave my hair greasy at all! The bottle is extra-large, so it lasts for months. There are no parabens or phtalates in this conditioner, so I have another reason to love it. This conditioner makes such a difference - it really is wonderful!"
1,"I loved all the different sized head options. The templates are cute as well but I never got to use them. This is very poorly made. I have owned a number of hair trimmers/razors and this one broke the fastest. The plastic pieces are horribly low quality. Mine broke the second time I used it. The heads didn't snap on/off well. Buy a different trimmer, save your money."
5,Goes well with sleeping on the floor. I no longer have the need to place my hands/arms under the pillow. Conforms to your head and neck and doesn't over heat.<br /><br />By no means is this a standard pillow; the pillow is not cushiony nor does it have any spring/rebound (obvious statement since it is filled with hulls) to it. In other words the hulls will not compress.<br /><br />It feels good to wake up without a stiff neck.
5,This product works like a charm. I'll continue buying it as long as I keep getting these results. I recommend it.
3,This Stuff Really Works my bestfreind used it to get rit of her baby weight and i used it to drop a few pounds. be warned that it causes mayor stomach cramps and you will have to go to the bathroom. thats the only reason it gets 3 and not 5 stars
3,"The steamer does steam, but you have to add water every 20 to 30 min. Also drips on the gloor. On the other hand, my hair feels very soft and moisturized. I've used it 3 times. Update: I have bought this steamer twice. I like the timer, it makes my hair feel soft. However, it is not a well made product. The rolling base is not sturdy at all. The only problem both times has been that the rolling base wheels break EASILY."
5,"This is a nice, sturdy scale for a good price. It was delivered quickly and in good shape. Just wish I didn't have the need for it!"
5,Great product! Put 2 on in our house and it elevates the seats to a MUCH more comfortable height. Ordered this one for my sister-in-law who is having medical issues and she loves it also. I don't know why they make toilet seats so LOW - they should be manufactured at this height to begin with then we would not have to buy another product to raise them to a comfortable height.
5,I highly recommend these for anyone trying to get pregnant. They will save you a lot of money over the long run! You won't feel guilty for testing all the time with these.
5,great organic beeswax!
1,No one is likely to buy without knowing how much of what is in it. Sorry.
4,Good
5,Great Purchase
3,Too big for me to swallow
5,"I have used this product for several years and it really works. It takes a few weeks to see the best results. I thought I didn't need it anymore and stopped taking it. My symptoms returned and I realized it was this product that was working and not the end of my symptoms. I started taking it again, and it is working again. I recomend this product to everyone I possibly can! I have no side effects."
1,"This stuff makes your hair smell like a dead animal. I've contacted the company via email as well as tried calling with no response.<br /><br />My first review was in August 2014 about a few weeks after using the product, it is now August 2015 and since I used this product it has actually damaged my hair. I have long hair and the texture changed...... and not in a good way. However, as my hair grows my normal texture is making a comeback! I would not wish this on my worst enemy, really!"
1,This thing is so hard to use and works really badly! I did not like the product! Not the manufacturers fault!
3,"I was surprised to see that this was their most popular product, ( why I ordered it). It does not do the job, with or without the cap. The one brand that I currently have and use really works. I just wanted something smaller to fit into a purse or luggage."
5,I resently purchased avon skin so soft bug gaurd. thumbs up. it really works. it is all I'll use forever
5,"These Ginger Tummy Drops are simply amazing (and delicious, too)!! I recently had surgery and was battling a bout of tummy upset. After sucking on these drops, the feeling went away! Consequently, I ordered another bag of Ginger drops, and a bag of Peppermint drops. I definitely want to keep these on hand for current and future use! Wonderful product!"
5,Great! As good as the original
5,"We were given this item when we had our first child. He is now 4 years old and we have been using it for our 1 year old. We keep it in his room and use it twice a day for naps and during the night. He sleeps much better (and longer!). Our first one just broke and we ordered our second one because we like it so much. I like that you can plug it in or use batteries. You can keep it on or use the automatic off button (turns off after 15 min, 30 min, or 1 hour). The crickets and heartbeat sounds kind of annoy me, but I like the waterfall, rain, and ocean. The rain forest is okay. I'd definitely recommend this item."
3,Took a while to get here but they worked well with me to make sure I received the product or a refund!
5,Works great!!
5,"Awesome brush for thick hair, curly hair or straight hair. I use it on my wet curly hair and it gets through all the tangles in a breeze. I also use it for my daughters waist length thick hair and it really does the job. I want to get more for around the house!"
5,"I can't claim that taking the recommended 3 softgels daily (3.6g) was responsible for any measurable memory improvement, weight loss or lower cholesterol but I can say that doing so didn't hurt at all. While the benefits of Lecithin are being debated and research is ongoing, I am happy with NOW's product because it has no 'bad' ingredients such as sugar, corn starch, salt, yeast, wheat, gluten, corn, milk, egg, shellfish or preservatives. NOW also states that their product is GMO-free - a good thing.<br /><br />Given the suggested serving size of 3 softgels, the 400 quantity should last for about 4 months if taken as suggested. The gels are easy to swallow and, since this Lecithin is extracted from soybeans, there is no aftertaste and I haven't experienced any digestive trouble.<br /><br />I am unaware of any negatives other than the lack of consensus on Lecithin's actual effectiveness but for a 'food supplement', not a miracle cure, this is a good product."
1,"We bought one these about 3 years ago. Massage was great. At about 27 months, a roller broke. We had to buy the whole back for about $500. About 14 months later it has failed again. This time its the controller.It is not dependable. Think twice before purchasing."
1,It does not work. Last night I took it three times and finally gave up and got out of bed at 4 AM because the pain only occurs in bed.
5,These little packets contain a lot of Biofreeze. You could use 1 pouch for two uses. Will definitely recommend. Easy and convenient for on the go. Plus fits anywhere if you need to throw in a bag for a quick trip out.
4,Great to be used with Ice machine cuff was on my husband knee. Great price and comfortable.
5,"I fly remote control planes and needed a timer I could hear when measuring flying times and battery discharge. My wife has one of these in the kitchen and loves it so much she won't let me touch it. The alternative was to purchase my own. Since I am hard of hearing, the long, loud ring on this timer is just perfect. All those digital timers with their little beep beep beeps were out of the question.<br /><br />This timer fits my needs perfectly. Easy to read, easy to set, and easy to hear. The only negative is that it is one minute off. For example, you must set it for one minute longer than the time you want to measure. This is not a problem for me. Maybe it's just in my timer. My wife's is accurate. I would definitely recommend this timer to anyone. You don't have tobe a rocket scientist to operate it. Price is right too.<br /><br />B.W. in Savannah Ga."
5,"These are magic, great for counters, bowls, pans, anything with a stain"
5,I love this product. The taste is soothing. I like to use goat products for replacing cow products due to a cow milk sensitivity. I like that fact that this is actually alkalizing as well.
5,Best gainer and protein! Chocolate is the best flavor and this one is well worth the money.
5,Great
1,"Oh my gosh, its like I can't go 3 hours without changing a diaper or if I pick my son up i'll have wet stains all over me. Money back guarantee is BS as well. 6 months to refund! Seriously? who cares after 6 months. I bought these in bulk and I won't even finish the other 100. Back to Pampers."
5,"Small chux pads are a must for a baby. We use them on top of the changing pad so we don't have to wash the cover every time there is an accident. We also carry them in the diaper bag so any couch (or lap) can be turned into a changing pad.<br /><br />The second time around, I ordered similar pads from another seller because I assumed they'd be the same and those were a little cheaper. Turns out, they are a little different. We like this brand better because it's softer and seems a little more absorbent. Not a huge difference though, sort of like a preference in paper towels - at the end they all do the job.<br /><br />Update: Now that our little one is a year old, we don't go through these pads quite as fast. They are still a must on our changing table. Our baby is very squirmy and sometimes it's hard to keep all the mess inside the diaper. If it wasn't for these pads, we'd have to have several changing pad covers and wash they much more frequently."
4,"We bought this for my wife's 88 year old aunt who lives alone. She doesn't want to pay (or let us pay) the monthly fees for an emergency call service, so we're trying this. Be forewarned: programming is complex, so it helps to have some geeky experience, and even at that it takes a good twenty minutes or more of patient work. But once programmed, it does dial numbers in sequence, awaiting a touch tone response before continuting to dial at one minute intervals. We put 911 in the fifth slot. In testing, I tried to hang up just as \\""9\\"" showed on the display. But 911 called back a few seconds later. Even though I said it was just a test, a cop shows up five minutes later \\""to make sure nobody is holding a gun to my head.\\"" Standard procedure. Yikes. Anyway, it seems to work."
5,needed for my mom...great price...good product
5,"I've taken these on and off for several months due to feeling sluggish. As far as I can tell, they seem to give me some energy."
5,"Reasonably priced, all natural, gives my hands a break from purell"
1,"Unfortunately, this did absolutely nothing for my vertigo. I didn't think it would but I was crossing my fingers. I'll keep the bottle in case I have any normal car sickness and see if it's any good for that."
5,"Soothes, stops itch, stays in place. Actually heals. Tried gels and such but this is a cream and I keep a small container in my purse."
5,"What a very good thing to have in your house in case there is ever an emergency, you can tell a lot just from the pulse. Some need to constantly be aware of their pulse, so having one at home is useful! Gurin sent me their Finger Pulse Oximeter for testing purposes and for my honest review and at 42 years of age and a person with a heart murmur and inverted T Waves, I feel much better knowing i have the little machine in case theres an emergency and 911 needs to know the persons pulse, i can take it.<br />This little device measures quickly and accurately pulse rate and SpO2 blood oxygen saturation of arterial hemoglobin levels.<br />It is seriously so easy to get your reading. First, take everything out of the box and insert the batteries that come included in the box.<br />Then, stick your finger into it and make sure the bottom of your finger is touching the sensor inside the Oxi"
5,"I have three children and I wish now that I bought this baby feeder years ago. My baby girl loves it! She sucks on all types of fruits and vegies that she will not eat from a bottle. She is satisfied with the taste and feel of the feeder. she loves to teeth on it. She cries for more! I feel confident and comfortable with putting any food in there and knowing it will not pose a choking hazard. when your baby is fussy and nothing will please him, try this feeder. Well worth the buy. Get two!"
3,i think packing simply too much.but product for my friends.
5,Awesome ain't nothing like the real thing baby. I'm sure if you try it you will love them too. They are so soft
5,"We have two year old twins, a boy and a girl. This diaper works equally well for both of our kiddos - no leaks even after 12+ hours of sleep! We started out with Huggies overnights, moved to a few other brands to try them out and ultimately jumped right back to Huggies (we do use Pampers for daytime use though). Great diaper, highly recommended!"
2,It takes three times as much of this brand in comparison to one by Sports Research.
3,"It work, but you have to give it time. as in couple weeks before seeing result"
5,I am a pediatric Occupational Therapist and I bought this for my clinic. The kids love it and I'm very happy with quality!
1,Doesn't work at all.
5,"I use these in my tag heuer, every time I have ordered the expire date has been 2 years. Buy in 2015, good till 2017. They last longer than that most of the time. Had a few duds, but when you get 10 for less than $10.00 that's pretty good. I recommend this product and this seller."
5,I bought this for my wife and it really looks like working for her. Initially for first week or 2 she couldn't find any difference but latter slowly it showing up. She is very much happy and planning to continue this.
5,"This is a good, solid, natural salt soap bar that goes a long way. Will definitely be ordering more in the future. You'll need a soap dish with grids or something that will raise it above the dish and allow it to completely dry and not sit in the water that runs off of it after each use. Do not use on freshly shaved skin or skin that is scratched or broken. WILL burn!"
5,"Love the organic and tho the dropper is slow, at least it doesn't go fast!"
3,"The label says 48 tsp. So, if I have 1 tbsp. per day, it seems to me that it should last 16 days. But, it only lasts 7 or 8 days. Am I figuring wrong?"
5,I have been using this product for a long time.<br />It both conceals blemishes and makes them go away/prevents new blemishes as well.
5,"This product is absolutely incredible. Living with a higher degree of adult ADHD, Koios works fantastic. Adderall had been my long time &#34;miracle drug&#34; for it, but because of the well known negative side effects of an amphetamine, I was seeking alternative routes...then I discovered Koios. It works nearly just as well as adderall did, but without all the less than pleasant side effects. I.e. dry mouth, the &#34;zombie like&#34; feeling when it wears off, the lethargic mornings, etc. I strongly recommend this product to anyone with ADHD, as well as anyone who is just wanting to sharpen their every day brain functions. I will stand by this product till the end of time, and the founder, Chris Miller, is an outstanding individual and a very good guy with the greater interest of all his customers in mind. I can't speak enough good words about him and Koios. If you don't use it this product, you're missing out on a lot. Huge double thumbs up for Koios."
5,Good.
5,"I have frequent stomach aches (due to acid indigestion etc) and I will try almost any product to relieve my pain. I must say, this product has helped! I take it along with my medicine made especially for acid problems. Since I added Advanced Probiotic to my diet, I have had less stomach pains - and it just makes me feel better about my health in general. The pills are not too large and they are easy to swallow. I give this product two thumbs up!"
4,"My oral hygienist recommended that I use a water pik to help keep my teeth and gums healthy. Out of the recommendations given, I decided to go with the ShowerBreeze. I'm glad that I did. Installation was easy. Using it is simple. And you don't have to worry about spraying water anywhere because you're already wet from being in the shower.<br />After using it I do feel a difference with the teeth."
1,Not very comfortable
4,Use of this oil has helped with the vertigo experienced.
5,this razor does a great job.. works well shaving my back...need to see how an were to buy replacement blades...anyone tell me were?
5,"AA batteries fit in the adapter fine, but they are slightly on the loose side so the batteries have a tendency to slide out. I use these for my Roomba's virtual wall and for a trash can. I haven't had any problems with the adapters not fitting into the battery compartments.<br /><br />Rechargeable C batteries are expensive and require a different charger, so these adapters allowed me to use my existing collection of rechargeable AA's instead. The AA's have to be switched out more frequently than if a &#34;real&#34; C battery was used. But I use the batteries in low power situations, so they still last quite a long time. Good buy."
5,Excellent Product!
5,Just got mine today and I love it actually. I was really skeptical but it really does make you sweat!
5,Ok
5,ITS A VERY nice PRODUCT... IT CAME AS I SPECTED I RECOMMENDED QUALITY 95%... WE ARE USING IT WITH NO TROUBLE AT AL
5,"These drops work great along with diet and exercise. I ve cut out all carbs, sugar and dairy. In 12 days I have lost 10 lbs. Very happy."
4,"Had tried another non-water orthopedic pillow, but it did not help. Read about the water pillow, and tried it. First night, noticed comfort and relief of neck and back stress. You open the package, and fill a pouch on the pillow with water. They suggest medium full, but for an adult male it is not firm enough. I tried filling it to firm setting and it worked well. The gentle support helps relieve stress, and the cushion effect is like that of a water bed. Takes standard size pillow covers."
5,"Great product, my wife loves it. Took care of my snoring problem!"
5,Excellent product
1,I'm not happy with it mad. That I bought four bottles. An nothing. Advice don't buy its a lie false advertising. I'm working. Out an everything changed the way I ate an still didn't lose. A pound. I wish I can get. My money back
4,"I've been using the medical travel bag for some days in hot climates in Per, it keeps cool my medicine but only for 3 or 4 hours, then it heats up quite faster. I hope that in the near future you can fix this issue so I can get at least 8 hours of cooling. Very nice product i'm satisfied and happy with"
5,"We have this dish soap in both the citrus scent and unscented varieties. I prefer the unscented kind. My sister, on the other hand, prefers the citrus scent. So I guess your preference will depend on if you like a scent to make things smell fresh or if you'd rather have less &#34;soapy&#34; smell. There is no residue left on the dishes after I use this unscented soap, and I love not having them smell like soap or fragrance of any kind.<br /><br />As for use, my sister and I are both loving the product. When I first put it in the kitchen, my sister kept making unsolicited comments about how much she loved it, so that makes it a winner in this household. No babies here, but we like to use products made for babies because we are sensitive to harsher ingredients. I especially love the foaminess of this soap. It's so easy to use just a little bit for quick cleanup of a dish or two, and it rinses clean without having to use scalding hot water. Definitely recommended."
3,"three issues:<br /><br />(1) your raw data is locked into the fitbit online service unless you pay $50/year for the premium service to unlock it. in terms of owning the data about yourself this is a really unfriendly policy.<br /><br />(2) could just be my device, but i've found that after it has been in use for 5 days+ without a full reset it will start to claim that i've climbed a flight of stairs every ~100 steps even on level ground. this causes me to end up with 100+ flights in a day which is really annoying because you can't remove just the stairs from your activities.<br /><br />after much searching i learned how to reset the device and now when i charge it i deliberately reset it (you plug it into the USB charger and hold the button for ~10s and it will power off, then you release and press the button again to power it on). when i reset it like this i also notice that it also seems to recalibrate its battery charge indication, and is frequently more empty than it was showing prior to the reset.<br /><br />in case it helps fitbit folks mine claims to have FITBIT 6.60 when it powers up.<br /><br />(3) (2014-07-12 edit) in the span of 3 days fitbit awarded me the 1000 floors badge and the 2000 floors badge, and the above bug (2) didn't even occur during this period: nothing on my tracker indicates i climbed 1000 floors."
5,I liked this item and will buy it again.
5,Very pretty color... Fits in my purse nicely. Very smart idea. I bought this for my friend who frequently shares nail polish with her mom. It puts her mind at ease that the product has added protection against contamination!!
5,"what doc recommended, for reasonable price"
5,"A friend's company were offering it's use as a wellness program and it caught my interest. I researched and purchased from Amazon.com<br /><br />Pro:<br />Small<br />Light<br />Tracks sleep pattern, stairs, distance walked, calories burned<br />Nice integration with web or android apps, sends encouraging emails when goals are met or close to be attained<br />syncs to my Galaxy SIII via Bluetooth and to my PC app via supplied Bluetooth micro dongle<br />Battery lasts 5 days<br />easy to plug in USB charger design<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Have to remove it from the silicone case and insert into a pouch on a Velcro attached wrist strap -- not hard to do but a bit of a pain to have to remember every night (not an issue if you don't care about tacking your sleep)<br /><br />The Clip while seemingly well made and securely attached to articles of clothing, can eventually detach based on where it is attached: My story: Just a quick note to ensure you know where your fitbit is at any given time -- Mine was hooked to the inside of my left pants pocket facing in. It seemed like a secure fitting clip but somehow, (maybe the getting in and out of my car), it shimmied loose and went AWOL..<br /><br />Luckily, based on the last time it synced and knowing where I generally was at that time, I was able to zero in on where it might have detached and amazingly lucky for me I called the Office Depot that I had been perusing around that time and they actually found it and put it aside for me!! VERY LUCKY!<br /><br />I have since engaged my trusty Brother label maker and affixed my cell # to the back of the device and inside the clip to hopefully help it find it's way home should it ever happen again...<br /><br />If it was lost, for me, I was not going to spend another $90 unless there is a better designed belt clip...<br /><br />Over all a great tool to keep track of your fitness and to get an idea of your sleep pattern."
5,Love this product and the company!!
5,Very pleased with product quality. Sturdy bag. Prompt delivery.
5,its a great oil and its so light so you dont feel like you got oily skin or scalp I mix it with my other oils
5,Great value! Great delivery speed.
1,I sent it back wrong product
5,Biofreeze works extremely well - I love it! Great for neck and lower back pain.
4,I received a free bottle for this review. I take 3 capsules instead of two for each dose. I prefer to take it at night before bed. I seem to be getting better pumps in the gym since I been taking this.
5,I have used Systane Lub Eye drops for over 3 years and always get the relief from them when they are needed to sooth my eyes be eye strain or other. Highly recommend as they do an excellent job for me.
5,"This stuff is expensive, but is good."
5,Good quality oil. Don't care for the smell too much but that's not the purpose of it anyway. Great deal for the price.
5,"helps prevent a cold<br /><br />Suma is very nutritionally rich. It contains antioxidants, amino acids, vitamins A, B, E, and K, minerals, and electrolytes. The electrolytes and B vitamins provide its energizing effect. Suma root is sometimes called \\""Brazilian ginseng.\\"" A slightly misleading name though, as suma is not actually part of the ginseng plant family, it just has similar, energizing qualities. Suma also contains germanium, which boosts the immune system. Perhaps most interesting is that suma root contains two anabolic agents, allantoin and ecdysterone, that have been linked to muscle growth support and enhanced endurance."
5,"Good feeling .from using it.......in conjunction with other excersizes (treadmill and stationary bike,free weights)also good for getting the kinks out first thing in the morning. Well worth the money. Bought one for our middle daughter (Julie) who uses it daily.<br />Thanks,<br />Jim&Pamela Terry"
5,"The railing is easy to assemble. It slides neatly between mattress and box spring. Once in place, it is very sturdy and a good support device."
1,"I've tried several different compression stockings as I do a lot of cross country flying. These are the worst of any of the brands, they're fine dress socks but aren't much more than that. The Gold Toe Mens Basic Rib Firm compression is a much better sock."
5,I cannot imagine anyone whining about this very classy and high quality monitor.
5,"This is my all-time favorite deodorant and I am so sad they don't carry it in stores anymore... thankfully Amazon comes to the rescue! This is the only deodorant I have ever found that smells wonderful and not too strong, and goes on clear and stays clear... and people don't believe me but I swear it has lightened the skin in my armpits and has also made the hair that grows there much lighter and fewer in number. Please don't ever stop selling this!"
5,Works very good
3,Not as good as Quercetin for relieving histamine intolerance
5,I purchased this for my husband who has very tight achilles tendons. He keeps it in his office and uses it to stretch when he is on the phone. He says it works well and he is very satisfied with the quality of the product.
1,I bought this product and it worked great for 2 months then completely stopped. Unless you are prepared to replace it every 60 days do NOT buy this.
5,"I just got a diffuser, and along with it some oils to put in it. I found that I really enjoy using the diffuser- but don't like paying the pricey brand prices. Thought I would give these a try and I love them! I have not yet tried all the scents- just been too busy to do that but the sweet orange is wonderful, as is the peppermint and tea tree. I will most definitely buy these again."
5,"One month after received, found out memory one not function properly. For a top of the line model, very disappointed.<br /><br />Well, after contact Customer Service, they showed me to turn off \\""TruRead\\"". Now it worked perfectly."
5,I love it. good weight and the size progression with the beads is perfect. gotta love glass.
3,Great!
4,"These are good condoms, the shipping and price were great. They are very thin, which feels good. They are however a little smaller than average. Good price if you are looking to try them out."
5,Have used this product before. Will reorder.
3,"This product is okay, because it wasn't as useful as I would have hoped it would be. It didnt do what I was told it would do for my condition. I noticed a small difference but not a dramatic one."
5,These are so much better then just popping tums. Great product and you should give them a try. Great idea!
5,"I have being using this product to colour my hair. It does a great job and covers all my grey hair. I am almost 60% grey so i have to colour my hair often otherwise I will have the skunk look :)<br /><br />It works fast, not messy and easy to apply. It does not smell or give headaches. Leaves the hair feeling silky and smooth."
5,"A small pedometer that does what it is supposed to do.<br /><br />And the supplier was great as the pedometer was delivered as expected the day after the purchase.<br /><br />Now I can count my daily steps to ensure that I reach my goal of 10,000 steps a day."
4,Packaged really well for shipping. Didn't take too long to get here. Still not sure if the light is going to help or not but it's working properly and seems to be made well.
3,"I can honestly say the shipping was awesome. It has great quality but the merchandise was damaged and scuffed up. I also was upset because, the size chart was a little Off on recommended size. I was so excited about this product but just a little upset."
4,"There are hundreds of reviews on Amazon about this scale, and they are overwhelmingly positive, which is why I chose this particular brand and model. After two weeks of use, here is my summary:<br /><br />Design: Perfect! Sleek, modern, light weight, and super thin. Now I just need to by a modern loft downtown to put this thing in! Did Apple design this scale?<br /><br />Weight Measurement: Perfectly accurate and delivers a very quick reading, less than three seconds. What more could I ask for?<br /><br />Body Fat Measurement: Relatively accurate, but needed to be calibrated by adjusting the height of the individual. This was a bit of a disappointment. After programming the unit for myself and the wife, my body fat reading was at least 10% off, reading much less than my actual body fat. Unfortunately, I knew what my body fat % was, so I couldn't be blissfully ignorant and content with the 14% reading, which is optimal health. My wife, on the other hand, was off about 5% in the other direction. In the time it took for the scale to be delivered, she got 5% fatter!! WTF? I emailed EatSmart, and they replied within hours, giving me instructions to change our heights in user program. This will either slow down or speed up the electrical signal to align the measurement with what we knew our actual body fat percentages are. From here on out the scale will be calibrated correctly and the measurements accurate. So far so good, over the two week period or percentages have remained constant, as expected.<br /><br />Other Measurements: Water, Bone, & Muscle. These are just bonus numbers to me, all I am really concerned with is weight and body fat. The numbers seem to fall in line with what I would expect from the charts listed in the user manual, but I really don't pay too much attention to them.<br /><br />Overall: After the adjustment to the body fat settings, I am happy with the scale, and I love the step on technology; no buttons to push or taps needed. I deducted one star for the body fat issue, otherwise this would be a solid five star scale."
3,"I was initially pleased by the quality and texture of the toy, not to mention the suction is an absolute plus compared to others. However, cleaning it proves to be difficult, as the only way it will dry is if you manually reverse it and hand-dry with a towel. It will not air-dry, which is important in maintaining longevity and preventing other things from accumulating (think of hair/fuzz from a towel, etc). I left it hanging upside down in an open, airy room for a full day and it was still damp. Not good.<br /><br />That minor detail aside, however, the real dilemma is the way the inner lining is formed. The outside is a thick pink mold, whereas the inside is a very thin sleeve bound along the edge of the sleeve itself. Within a week of very minimal use, the inner sleeve started to detach from the wall of the outer mold. Now there is a gap between the two layers that lets water inside (when cleaning) and is impossible to dry or clean out. It also slides and detracts from the experience of using the sleeve. The more it is used, the more it detaches. If I really wanted to, I could just slide my finger to the bottom between the layers and detach it entirely and remove it. Unfortunately it is this inner sleeve that provides the texture so that is a major issue.<br /><br />The fragile state is worrisome, as I cannot get much use out of the toy since purchasing it originally. It took little use to degrade to its current state, though I'm sure it is just a fluke in my particular unit's molding. Others seem to enjoy their sleeves, so I would be hopeful that anyone that purchases it has a better experience than me."
1,"Says vegi caps but that is misleading. Only the capsule is vegan. This supplement contains intrinsic factor derived from pigs (porcine). Intrinsic factor is produced by the stomach and is essential to the assimilation of B12. Some people need intrinsic factor supplement because they no longer produce intrinsic factor in sufficient quantities to assimilate B12. Yet I fail to understand why a company would bother to create and advertize a vegi cap when contents are derived directly from animal. On the positive side, the B vitamins are phosphates or methyls -- no oxides. That is very good and, truthfully, very hard to find. Despite being a vegan, I'm going to finish these vitamins because I'm not a total fanatic. But they get one star for misleading description. How many people even know what porcine is? I knew but missed the fine print. So, I recommend these B vitamins if you really need intrinsic factor with your B12."
5,Works as it should
5,"I use this on my feet alot. Keeps them dry & stink free. I also lightly dust my shoes with it, helps keep moisture & stink down. Great!"
1,"preformed nose shape smashed both my husband and my nose. Also, strap around head was too tight for both of our heads (but we probably do have bigger heads than the average Joe)"
5,"These were great, I have tried most of this company's product and this one is at the very top. Helped with my sore feet so much I haven't had to buy new shoes yet."
4,"This is great for espressos, for regular coffee it tends to be a little bit too sweet. I do prefer it over the other stevia in the raw and most of the other stevia products,"
5,"I have been taking these pills consistenly for about 8 days. Hard for me to see results myself seeing that I am always wanting results faster than I should. I deal with losing weight like crazy and as I lose my butt and hips goes with it so I want something that works in like 24 hrs lol, but all jokes aside today someone just asked me what am I doing because it looks like im gaining weight on my hips and thighs. That means this stuff is really working and im happy"
5,"I was ordering this directly from LifeExtension but could no longer locate it on their website. I was super pleased to find it here since it was a great deal less money and the delivery was faster.<br /><br />I have been taking this along with life extensions super r-lipoic acid and super ubiquinol coq10 with enhanced mitochondrial support since january in hopes of increasing my energy levels and improving general health. The combination did allow me to return to a more youthful energy level but it didn't take long for me to notice a side effect I didn't expect... I have lost 17 lbs since January 8th and have not restricted my food intake in any way. I have also not excersized at all. I am now at my ideal weight for my height and my bmi is also appropriate. (I had given up and figured the extra weight went along with my increasing age) I have continued to take the supplements to help with general health and energy levels for an additional 6 wks. I have not continued to lose weight. (which is good cause if I did I would be under weight by now)<br /><br />Before taking these supplements I never drank water. I mostly drank coffee and mt. dew. Since taking the supplements I find I don't need or want the extra sugar and caffeine; I actually want water. (maybe that is why I lost the weight)<br /><br />I would purchase from this supplier again and have recommended them to family and friends.<br /><br />As a reminder, please consult your personal physician before taking any supplements."
5,I love it works good
5,good
5,My husband says that this is the best all-natural deo that he has used thus far. We've tried all kinds! Doesn't stop the sweating - just the odors. That is what we are looking for ! For those of you that have never used all natural deodorants before - It takes about two to three weeks for your body to adjust to these. Give it time.
5,Very good product
5,I am extremely happy with this purchase. I broke my tailbone many years ago as a teenager and have suffered with sitting for long periods of time ever since. This cushion really does the trick for me and believe me I have tried many to no avail.! I definitely recommend this product. Thank you.
5,my third hand and its great
1,No results noticed in weight but did help me sleep better
5,This stuff works really goodand it has a good price. Thank you for offering these at a great deal.
5,it really worked extremely well. I put it on an hour before. I didn't need to take breaks and the pain was much more manageable than my previous experience.
4,This product is a great way to ease the pain of entry. My partner and I love it. I recommend to any buyer.
5,"great product to use for general wellness,. and a secret tip from me to you is: use orally onto skin for a very quick reaction."
2,"I tried it, I think I followed all the instructions, but I didn't see any noticeable difference in the color of my teeth."
5,These are awesome
3,"theyre well priced. i also like that theyres 5 in a pack, and they come in nice colors. but i dont like that they take many tries to light"
5,"Excellent for dry, cracked feet/heels. We put it on our feet at night, cover with a sock and wake up with good results. The longer we use this lotion, the better the results, but results happen pretty quickly."
1,Turns off frequently and wake up my son
5,"Excellent product with easy to drink flavor. It really puts the stop to cramps, and can be a key component of your training and performance plan."
5,Have been drinking a cup of this tea every morning for 15 years. Tastes good and I feel that I am benefiting from it. And reasonable price too!
3,I like the idea of this product but there isn't a sound that is low enough.
1,Did not work!!! Also was disgusting!!
5,"Still getting used to it... I won't go into detail (tmi), but let's just say it takes some practice. I think that once I get it down, it will be great. Product is well made and customer service is great. I'm giving 5 stars because the product is not to blame for my dysfunction."
4,Shipping took less time than expected from China. Works great.
5,"First, contrary to one of the the 1-star reviews, I am a &#34;real person&#34; who has used this product. I think it's excellent. My wife bought this for me as I tend to go around barefoot in the summer and my heels get very dry and crack. This Pedi has helped immensely! Yes, if enough pressure is applied, it will slow down or stop. Well, come on folks, just don't exert such pressure! Give it a chance to work."
5,I have been taking these pills for years and swear by them.
5,"There are some other reviewers who have noted that the newborn diapers aren't so great. I have to agree. We tried the newborns and they were a disaster so we switched to Huggies Pure and Natural. The Huggies worked great but were so expensive that we decided to go back to the 7th Gen when our baby got big enough for the size 1 diapers. Now he's on to size 4 and we've had no complaints. The only \\""leaks\\"" we've had were from the crazy blowouts that I don't think any diaper could have contained. So, to sum it up, if you're reading this review then you obviously care about things like chlorine free diapers, environmental impact, etc and if you care about those things then you certainly can't go wrong with these 7th gen diapers as long as you stay away from the Newborn size."
3,"It gets the job done, but I won't be buying it again. The perforations are not deep enough to ensure that the sheets tear on the line. The squares also tear easily in the middle, which combines poorly with the lame perforations. That means that it frequently tears during use, which sucks. This is a very linty paper, which is highly susceptible to &#34;pilling&#34;, like after you wash a wool shirt.<br /><br />On the plus side though, it was pretty cheap, and it's really soft."
5,Twinlabs is another reputable company. This helps control your cholesterol.
4,"This product does work, when I take it at night and wake up the next morning, I can feel that my stomach is a lot tighter."
4,"Good stuff, not as strong or tough a flavor as sun food version. i would recommend it to my friends"
2,"The rabbit worked, but vibrating beads didn't. Came partially broken right out of the box. The rabbit felt nice and made me cum quickly, but no beads."
5,"My hubby go hearing ads the audiologist recommended getting something to dry them, read the reviews of this so decided to try it! Glad we did, it is so easy to use and does a great job of not just drying but also dsinfecting with UV light!"
5,"THIS is the one you've been looking for! Seriously...I spent DAYS researching whey concentrate. Reading ingredient lists and reviews. I felt there just wasn't going to be one that was just plain whey concentrate from cared for grassfed cows. BUT...I found it! The Organic Whey is just the one! They are a part of a co-op of farmers who agree to treat the cows with care, it's from grassfed cows, there is NO sugar or worse, fake sugar, no flavoring in this one...just wonderful whey concentrate. And NO SOY! It's great! We drink protein shakes after working out. The taste is just what you would want...milky, frothy, delicious! I love this concentrate! The smell is great, the taste is great. Do yourself a HUGE favor and stop looking now. Just order from this small wonderful company and get on with other things in life...like working out! :-)"
3,Slightly heavy cream
5,Best product on the market.
5,Just as shown fast and easy
5,"These are the perfect protective cover for the medical patch my wife needs weekly. They stay on in the shower and keep the patch dry. There are many other uses for these like covering an IV site and I will speak only from our own experiences. They are easy to put on with a little practice, and they are easily removed again without damaging your skin. The individual packaging insures a long shelf life that keeps the dressing ready for years without drying out. Purchasing these in bulk saves 60 to 80 percent over a pharmacy or medical supply store. This packaging option, (100), qualifies for free shipping, offering further savings. The vendor ships extremely fast (usually same day). This is not the first time we have purchased these from this vendor and we have not been disappointed."
2,"I really liked this thermometer until the battery died during my first cycle of charting. I brought this product new on Amazon and it died after using it less than 25 times. I thought at first it had broken somehow when I had it in my luggage (travel for work), but I just swapped out the battery from a fever thermometer I've had for about 5 years (battery still going strong!) and then my Nexcare thermometer worked again.<br /><br />I missed about 3 days of charting in my luteal phase--I am not happy about that because I am tracking with FertilityFriend.com and I want to be able to compare my charts over time."
1,Not happy. They should change the mirror label to chrome 'cause that's what it is. It's not shiny at all. So disappointing.
5,"I spent 1 year thinking about this scale: &#34;Is it acurate? Do I really need the wi-fi? Is it worth the money?&#34;<br />And I came to the following conclusion:<br />- It's the most beautifull scale I've ever seen<br />- The weight it's super accurate - It measures till 0.01kg - not that I need it, but it's good to have that precision.<br />- It's the most simple thing to use in the whole world - You just step on it, and it reads your weight, body fat %, and BPM. And at the end it recognizes you and sends the data to your account. Currently 5 people use my scale and the scale works perfectly.<br />- The Wi-Fi, THE WIFI - This is the thing that makes it all worth it. The ease! The simplicity. This saves you so much work. At first it may seem useless, but when you use it... I fell so good seeing my progression from this last 3 months (when I bought the scale).<br />I can see my everyday weight from this last 3 months; and because I track my calories too, I can make a correlation and figure out what is working with me and what is not.<br />- I dont really need the BPM but it's nice too see mine slowing down as I keep doing cardio and geting used to it.<br />- The Health Mate Website is super clean, and shows you everything you need to see with precision and beauty.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend it to EVERYBODY. It could be a bit cheaper, but the scale is great and a good investment. It improves your life quality easily."
5,This product is great..worth every penny
1,Do not waste your money on this product. I have been taking it as suggested on the bottle and it doesn't do anything.
4,"Had one for six, seven years before and wanted to replace it.<br />Tough and kid resistant; Ours simply became more cloudy with age."
5,"My wife found this site and decided to try their products, and they are great &#34;She Said&#34;. Thank you for making my wife happy."
5,"This review is for:<br />Depend Guards for Men, Maximum Absorbency...<br /><br />We bought these for my father, who is 83. He has been having a bit of trouble with incontinence at night while sleeping. These Depend Guards for Men are just what the doctor ordered. Literally, the doctor said he should get these. Because he's embarrassed about his problem, we had to get them for him and show him how to use them.<br /><br />These are a thick, absorbent product that fits men well. The guards are shaped like underwear and have an adhesive strip that holds them in place in your underwear. They stay put well and are absorbent enough to capture and hold almost any accident, day or night. The package contains 52 guards for protection day and night. They are not noticeable when worn in the underwear. They work in boxer-briefs and briefs. They do not work well in standard boxer underwear.<br /><br />This is a great product that just work right out of the package. They are absorbent and do not show when worn correctly.<br /><br />**I purchased this product at full price for personal use."
5,i purchased the product for my teenage daughter the results are fantastic ! within days of its usage their was s noticable improvement.. we have tried other products from high street chemists and also dietry changes but these have not had a positive effect. i would advise anyone with acne to give it a go.
5,The Best protein in my opinion
3,The wool in my second pair of UGG Coquettes seemed to wear out awfully fast. This is the second pair of insoles that I've bought for them. The first pair seemed to be a little nicer but I couldn't find that particular one on Amazon this time. This pair will do and they are cheap enough that I can replace often if needed.
5,"I love this stuff! I've tried everything to help my brittle, weak nails. This is the first thing that has actually worked! I can no longer peel my nails apart, they are so strong after 1/2 a bottle that it kind of hurts to clip them! I was so happy to find a three pack. It is expensive but worth it!"
5,"I am very pleased with my purchase of this case. I really like them. The cases are a firm. Curved glasses like safety glasses fit into these cases. I order some Dewalt Safety Glasses from Amazon and I noticed a pair listed that had a smoked lens (Dewalt DPG58 2C). Also another pair that said indoor/outdoor (Dewalt DPG58 9C). I ordered both along with regular safety glasses. So the reason I am putting this here is the glasses are rather large in the way they curve back deeply. A regular flat case will not hold them. This case works great but the safety glasses just fit snuggly in this case. If you think your glasses may be larger then I recommend \\""Eyewear Safety Glasses Case Belt Hook Zipper\\"" From ERB. The ERB case is soft cover and is larger. For an idea of the size of glasses these cases will hold look up the safety glasses I listed."
5,It is the best compared to some products I ave ever used. It is really moisture and natural like my own. I would recommended this product.
5,"When on an extended visit to my son's home, awaiting the birth of a new grandson, I loved the softness achieved with the Smart Sheep Dryer balls so much, that I ordered some for myself so that they would be awaiting me when I arrived home."
5,This product seems to work good. Sometime there are other factors that interfere with my sleep but I take this about 2 times a week and am happy with it.
5,"Great. Needed these to know when I could go in for a pre-employment screening at a local hospital. Today's my 3rd day with no cigs. This morning I had a VERY faint line then this afternoon it was even darker! Gonna take a couple more tomorrow then go in day after tomorrow for my test! I think I would pass tomorrow, but better safe than sorry since my deadlines not for a couple more weeks. I haven't even had awful cravings at all! (I think that was partly helped by being HORRIBLY hungover from a wedding my first quit day.)"
5,My favorite flavor. Not too sweet.
3,not as powerful as suggested
4,I was scared that this powder would taste nasty like some of the others that I tried. but it is actually pretty good<br /><br />the first few times I tried it I really felt the energy coming but after a few uses I noticed less of a result but I still get the energy I<br /><br />need. I wont workout without it!
5,We used to get these pills using a prescription and they were quite expensive. This is the same exact bottle the prescription pills were dispensed from and the price is about 80% less than we formerly paid. Go Amazon :-)
5,I have used LOC for years and would not be without it. I always use it to pretreat for stains and for any type of stains around the house. Also great for regular cleaning!
5,"This works great for me to when my little girl is stuffy before bed. The Booger Remover is far better than other suctions, and I've used several of them. My girl does not like it, however, to my delight my 3-year-old requests that I should utilize it on him when he's very stuffy. My girl had a terrible cough brought on by her mucus that formed up, and I used the booger remover and it truly helped treat the cough."
5,This thing had me cummin in no time
2,My step-dad did not give it a chance to work on his sore. His sore has finally got to the doctor and been declared squamous cell carcinoma. I have used it on the ring around the finger peeling I get every time I pull weeds. Not gone yet.[[ASIN:B0030EAU1C Terrasil Max Therapeutic Skin Ointment 14 Gram Jar]]
4,Arrived in good condition.
5,"Goes on nice under make up, and is not greasy, but moisturizes very nicely. I like that it come in a bigger container<br />and it lasts awhile."
5,"These are absolutely great. The El wire shines nice and bright and it is adhered to the glasses very nicely. Like in the description, it shines a solid color or blinks. I don't know if I just didn't read close enough, but there is also a setting that allows the light to blink along to the bassline of the music you're listening to. You can set the sensitivity of this feature depending on how loud the music is that you're listening to.<br />It comes with a battery pack with the controls on it, and it has a long cord that makes it easy to hide the battery pack in a pocket or backpack etc. I definitely recommended these if you're a night goer, or go to a lot of parties. It's very affordable and attracts a lot of attention."
5,"Ordered this Monday - it arrived Tuesday! with Standard shipping! Unfortunately, they sent the wrong one.... the one I got was from Invacare, had 225 pound capacity, with one year warranty... called them... they said I had the wrong one, sent me another one that arrived in 2 days! It's what appears in the ad... Bantex, 275 pound capacity, lifetime warranty... returned the first one at no charge to me... This is REAL customer service!"
5,Definitely got my monies' worth and I'm happy I purchased. Will be purchasing again soon and will recommend to friends.
3,"These are very small and flimsy. You get what you pay for, so I upgraded from 2 to 3 stars. They're fine for supplemental little brushes to keep in a bathroom or kitchen cabinet for little cleanups, but that's about it."
5,"I now own two sets because I NEVER want to be without them. One set is just for back up. So happy I found these. I have back issues and fibromyalgia. They give a very firm support which I need. But if that is not your preference you may not like them. As far as arm support, I use pain rollers to prop my arms on since I need to keep them handy anyway. Also inflatable sports balls work as arm rests when I prefer softer support for my arms. I prefer the narrow size because I constantly have to tailor the cushions to what I need and they are easy to maneuver. If I heard that this company were going out of business, I would probably buy ten sets. That's how much I like them."
5,"AWESOME PRODUCT AND PACKAGING! this was the sheeeet, lots of smoke and really good flavor and easy to store. yay!"
1,"My necklace broke within a few weeks of purchase. (The bracelet I bought with it was too small. I wore it anyways, and it fell off within days and I lost it.)"
5,"excellent price, short expiration date"
5,"Anyone who hates that oily makeup remover or expensive makeup wipes should jump on this product! It's made out of an extremely soft fabric and with just a little bit of warm water, any kind of makeup comes off with ease! I don't wear a lot of makeup, just some eyeliner and mascara & it works great, but even my sister, who cosplays and wears full-faced makeup with shadow, concealer, bb-cream, etc. can take off her makeup with this one nifty towel; extremely satisfied with this product & if I ever need to I will be sure to buy again & again! &#60;3"
2,"I started using this product for a month and I really haven't noticed a thing yet. Maybe it's too soon? I kind of naturally have pretty good eyelashes anyway, so maybe I am maxed out on the results. Not sure, but I will keep using it for another month. It says you can also put this on your eyebrows. I have an area that had been overtweased and the hair is bare there. It has done nothing in that area to regrow hair."
4,"I'm pretty sure this humidifier is meant for children, but I got it for myself anyway. It is pretty much exactly what the description says it is - an adorable elephant humidifier that holds 1 gallon. It works well, and I like that it shuts off automatically when it runs out of water. It's not noisy. It seems to work just fine. I only gave it 4 stars because I can't seem to refill it without leaving a small trail of dripping water (but nothing egregious), and although it says that it's suitable for a room of 500 sq ft, it doesn't seem like the steam travels that far from the humidifier. But this is my first humidifier, so maybe those things are typical."
5,Gentle to stomach and works great!
5,Good product. I'd buy it again.
5,"Absolutely the best ever! Even works on ceramic cook tops, and it smells so clean!"
5,Best children's vitamins! I don't allow my child to have gummies or sticky candy but these don't stick to the teeth because the sugar is on the outside. Taste delicious!
4,"This product works great when training hard, I recover faster and feel better on my runs, especially when running intervals. Takes about four weeks to start working."
1,The gel rips easily and after 4 times wearing it one of the gel guards ripped so I can no longer use it. Sadly disappointed
5,"I was thinking about ordering but when I read the reviews I decided against it. The reason why - I am reading two or three paragraphs from people that give it 3 stars or less, and they go into detail that they do not like the product. Then I see about 8 five star reviews, but they are all the same. Two quick sentences saying..... \\""Oh wow, Loved the product. Loved the price. Worth every penny . Lost a lot\\""...... I think representatives of Sensa are leaving these 5 star comments. If you really love it, then REALLY explain why!"
5,Good Protection for Waterproof!!!!!
1,The springy part of the tubing that keeps tension on the ear pieces has broken twice now. I can't recommend buying this.
2,I am not sweating enough even after 40 minutes at level 5. It is very warm but not hot. I think I need to heat up more with the FIR. I don't want to sit on the floor in it. Anybody else not sweating enough? Ideas?
3,"This stuff cleans great...however, the smell is a little too powerful for me."
5,Works well and received promptly
5,"I have been taking these for a while and found them on amazon. I was amazed at the price difference. I was paying $29.99 for 30 at a local store! I have tremendous problems w/ my stomach so taking fish oil is very hard for me and I always have burp ups even w/ items like this that are burp-free. I still get burps BUT they taste like oranges and not fish, so I am will settle for that because omegas make me feel better!"
4,"These work pretty good and they are convenient. Hard to read in the sun and outside, but if you shade them, you can make out the readings. Good for the price."
1,"I got 2 packages of herbalife formula 1 when I started a weight loss challenge, french vanilla, and cookies n cream. The &#34;cookies&#34; in cookies n cream were gross, and they all sunk to the bottom of my cup. Both mixes were clumpy unless mixed in a blender. I had 2 shakes a day with protein-rich snacks, a nutritious dinner, drank lots of water, exercised, and cut out sweets. I lost a grand total of 1.5 pounds. I was also in a very foul mood the whole time I was doing this challenge despite eating better and exercising. Come to find out, herbalife shakes are made out of soy protein, and soy disrupts your hormones. A disruption in hormones for me meant I was sad, very irritable, and tired. I wish I would have done some research on soy before I made it such a big part of my diet. I will not be purchasing any herbalife products again and certainly don't recommend it."
5,"it works, if your insides are ready with something."
5,"This scale has been a great addition to our household! It is so cool how it &#34;recognizes&#34; each person and gives a summary of weight loss after the initial reading. There are four of us in the house and each one can have a record of progress or change, just by stepping on!"
5,Great value
5,does a great job keeping my bangs in place. not so good at keeping bigger chunks of hair in place
4,"This is a decent value, however buyers should be aware that the product is only 20% by weight of phosphatidyl serine (PS). I believe that the seller should clearly state this. (This product is derived from soy beans, and the remaining 80% consists of other phospholipids such as phosphatidyl choline.) (NOTE: 20% strength is typical for PS powder; other commonly available strengths are 50%, and 99%; most PS supplements in capsule form use a 20% strength powder). What this means is that for each 500 mg of powder, you are getting 100 mg of PS. Thus 100 grams of this PS powder gives you 20 grams of actual PS, which is equivalent to a bottle of 200 capsules each containing 100 mg PS. With this powder, you are paying ($35.55/200) = $0.18 per 100 mg of PS. For comparison, the best value bottle of PS I could find on iherb (Doctor's Best, Best Phosphatidyl Serine, 100 mg, 120 Veggie Caps, $31.98) worked out at around $0.26 per 100 mg serving. So with this powder, you ARE saving money (18 cents versus 26 cents per 100 mg serve). There are other advantages to powder over capsules/ softgels. Powders can be sprinkled on foods or blended into smoothies. I like to blend my PS powder in my whey protein drink for example. Regarding storage, I tip the entire pack of powder into a plastic tub with an airtight lid, and store it in the fridge. If you keep it chilled, it's possible to take a spoon of the powder and sprinkle it into e.g., a smoothie without the powder sticking to the spoon."
5,"I have been taking this product for about 1 year and love it. I can not find it in the stores locally, so I order it from Amazon. I have some minor health issues and have to be careful of over the counter products. Hyland is perfect, because it is natural. As soon as I feel a cold coming on, I start taking Hyland and I don't suffer through a bad cold, just a minor one. The same is true, when I give it to my grandson. Good taste"
4,yummy! good energy boots when you're outside all day working or hunting/fishing.
3,"personally i would choose these over any doctor prescribed anti espasmodic, this is natural and chemical anti spasmodics dont work a great deal anyways and can have collateral effects ; so avoid chemicals and try peppermint oil"
5,"When you purchase the Hitachi, you've got to know what you're getting. You're not getting one of those novelty vibrators that'll work for about 100 uses (six months at best) and then putter out or otherwise breakdown. You're also not getting a regular vibrator, with service vibrations simply do the trick. The Hitachi is incredibly powerful, packing up to 6000 rpm on the high setting, its reputation is very good and it will last in all likelihood a large portion of your sexual life. We're talking years, and decades if you care for it well. In addition, the vibrations that the Hitachi provides are not only powerful, but penetrating and deep. It woke up parts of me that I didn't know were there. It's funny because I thought that the sheer vibrating power of the Hitachi would make me less sensitive and stop me from enjoying my partner as much. Wrong. If anything, it was a sexual aid and made me more sensitive and responsive to my partner, and even other vibrators. I've had my Hitachi for 4 months, and at the beginning I didn't like it as well because it \\""worked\\"" so quickly that there was no build up. But after spending a few months with it, it's hands down my favorite toy. Also, amazon's pricing is a steal for what you're getting; other websites or sex shops sell the Hitachi for as much as $50. The one thing to watch out for, and the one downside, is that although it is a machine with incredible, deep vibrations and last power, the material isn't really built for sensitive tissues, and it shows. It's made out of vinyl and with frequent use, even if that's just every couple days or so, it tends to irritate skin. Even so, it's worth the buy and putting a condom over the head or buying an inexpensive attachment (I just ordered the natural contours g-spot attachment) you can make an awesome toy damn near perfect."
5,"As I've been getting old, I've been trying to find a solution to showing my age. A friend recommended this product to me and I must say ive been 100% happy with the results. By just taking 1 pill a day I've already begun to notice a change. Wrinkles seem to be smoothing out day by day. Also I feel like. I have a healthier look as well. I'm going to continue using this product for a long time"
3,"I like this gloss. It's thick and fairly sticky, but it smells good and stays on well. There isn't a lot in the tube. It's only a dollar per tube but there isn't as much gloss as there is in comparable brand lipglosses that cost three or four dollars. Still, its a good product and I like it."
5,This stuff is great. Use it everyday in my morning shake. Used to use Garden of Life Raw Protein powder but that is full of additives (read the label). Tried Sun Warrior's regular protein blend but that doesn't digest as easily for me as this Warrior Blend. Natural flavor works for me.
5,12 weeks on crutches is a challenge - but these pad covers made it so much better! They are soft and comfortable and so easy to use. And the color is great - people complimented them everyday! The covers are machine washable - you'll want to throw them in the laundry about once a week. I would recommend these to anyone who has to use crutches. Two thumbs up!!!
3,"The Kanechom works ok as a conditioner. It moisturizes and leaves the hair soft and with elasticity. My problem is the heavy perfume, remove that and it would be a 4 star item. As far as the Silicon, I thought it would work well on my hair type which is natural 4a hair. It was awful!!! My hair is thin and this weighed it down and made it look greasy even though there was no grease involved. I am going to use the Silicon one more time but a much less amount to see if it works otherwise I've use it twice and made my hair stringy and greasy and unattractive!!!"
3,I wish it was sharper to get more of the dead skin cells from the bottom of my foot.
5,excellent aaa rechargables
3,Does not seem to make any difference 2 months.
5,This little thing is Amazing!!! I perched this for my Husband.... hes been complaining about his lower back for a while now. Hes in a much better mood these days.
5,"I guess I'm just coming out of the dark ages because I didn't even know these existed until it appeared in the related items for something else I was searching for. On the up side I really do appreciate this cup and not having to deal with pads. No smell, convenient, place and forget for a while, easy to clean, saves money and waste. On the temporary down side being new to this it takes a bit of getting used to, namely; having to get it placed correctly, knowing how much time can pass before checking it, and finding the right insertion fold that's comfortable for you. YouTube videos are very informative! I also had to cut the tip down a little because it poked me. Very happy with this. I will be getting another one."
4,"Update: Well it turns out I did receive the wrong bottle. I'm not sure if that's the fault of Amazon or Online Healthy Offers. That being said, I can't praise Online Healthy Offers enough for correcting the mistake. I received an e-mail and a phone call from them and they rushed out the correct bottle and a prepaid return postage sticker for the wrong bottle.<br /><br />The correct bottle is a little on the large side. However, the powder container can be stored inside the bottle when storing in a cupboard. Supplements/vitamins can be stored in 2 compartment in the purple lid behind the drinking spout. The powder container has a purple lid that then screws onto the bottom of the orange bottle (although it screws on in the opposite direction) This bottle does have markings for 25 ounce. Overall I think it's a good value for the money.<br /><br />Pros: A true 3 in 1 bottle with 25 ounce markings, good value<br />Cons: Bottle is a little large<br /><br />Original Review: I purchased the 3 in 1 Sports Shaker Bottle. That's how it was advertised and that's how it's labeled on the product but that's not what I got. I got a simple shaker bottle. It's just like any other shaker bottle. There's no bottom mounted powder container or vitamin compartment. The bottle is clear not orange as advertised. It's a 25 ounce bottle but the markings only go up to 20. I don't know if I received the wrong product because it doesn't look like their posted picture and isn't a 3 in 1 despite how it's labeled."
5,"I've had indigestion, bloating, and gas as far back as I can remember and I would avoid certain foods like cheeses and dairy and spicy foods. Tried these pills and they work! I'm eating whatever I want and I'm not feeling any indigestion, no bloating and no gas. The pills are pretty small and easy to swallow with some water. I've noticed that my waistline has shrunk just a little bit thanks to the bloating going away. I would recommend these digestive enzymes to anyone who suffers from bloating, gas, and indigestion because they really do work and help the digestive process very effectively."
5,Excellent !!!! Caffeine free !!!
3,"I didn't notice any difference between this variety and any others that I've tried, and I feel like I've tried most of them. I worked as good as previous brands which means it sprayed as it should (medium -ish spray, not hard), and it caused my nose to run briefly which in turn helped to clear out my sinuses a little bit."
5,Using the eucalyptus oil in a recipe for a natural fly repellent for my cows. I have never tried NOW essential oils before but am pleased with the quality and the price.
3,My mother's doctor prescribed this for her. I buy the 42 count at Walmart for $16.79. BJ's wholesale sells it for $19.47.
5,"I've tried i3c from Now, Swanson, an i3c/dim mix and this has been the best so far, and the best price. I was taking dhea and dhea will convert to testosterone and estrogen kind of indiscriminately. So, I was getting the good with the bad. When I added this into my regimine I was definitely getting a whole lot more good than bad!"
2,This does not fit my leg and it is inconvenient. I suggest not to buy it.<br />Once again don't buy it.
4,"This has to be one of the best plant source, if not the best natural protein source supplements, out there on the market in powder form. With 20-22g of Protein per serving it is up there with Whey and Egg whites that many non-vegans usually turn to for supplementation. Not to mention the Amino Acid profile is rather extensive.<br />Plain is a staple as you can add your own flavors fruits or veggies and add it to baked goods or savory soups easily. My favorite is to add Raw Cacao powder, coconut/hemp oil and a bit of cinnamon and cardamom for a nutritious morning shake.<br /><br />For those sensitive to sugars the Fructose can be the kicker (thus my 4 star rating).<br /><br />I put this into rotation with some other protein supplements (hemp and egg white mostly) to change things up a bit.<br /><br /><3"
5,"Since I have been using this product, my black knits stay looking like new. I am not sure what is in the product, but it keeps the new look in black knits for a very long time. I have some that I have worn and washed weekly for over a year, and they still look like new."
4,"Dishwasher detergent is what it is, if I may be so profound. It seems expensive, but it's what Bosch calls for and I don't know the alternative. It does the job at least as well as the Cascade powder we used to use in our old Bosch dishwasher, but then our dishwasher was old!"
5,"Cant say enough good things since ive been consistently eating fiber before bedtime.<br /><br />These taste great, chew easy, go down easy, and makes everything come out even easier. :-)"
5,"After two years of trying various orthodic insoles to deal with plantar fasciitis pain, I finally went an Orthopedic who put me in one of these. It took a couple of months but I'm pain free. No more hobbling out of bed in the morning. The Dr. charged me $150 which was a small price to pay for the cure, then I saw it on Amazon for $20! The exact item and brand. I bought another one. Recommendation for wearing: if you sleep on your back your toes will point at the ceiling. This item does a great job of allowing that, as it protects your toes from getting crushed by the covers that are too tight. I wore mine loose and never tightened the side tension straps. My foot ached the first few nights so I would take it off. If you roll around in bed your other foot might get banged up a little bit (think about walking around in one ski boot) which is why I bought a second one. A body pillow between your feet would also work."
5,"I am very impressed with Doctor's Best, and use other products of this brand as well. I am taking this for joint problems, and it is working great for me. The price is awesome as well!"
5,This has been a great addition to my weight loss goal- no side effects and I've seen myself literally get &#34;smaller&#34;. Haven't loss any weight butt body is fitting better into my clothes.
5,Good
5,"This product works like it says. I am a 25 year old male and I was able to instantly notice a difference in energy, libido and strength. I was skeptical/embarrassed at first but soon discovered that the ends justified the means. I can't say that it's a wonder supplement, as I am very active in both cardio and lifting. However, with my current regiment this product passes the eye test with flying colors."
4,I was a bit concerned when I ordered this product. After using it for a few days I was very pleased that it did not cause shakiness. Very alert and energized but no bad side effects for me.
5,product works very well for many ailments
5,For our boys training at bootcamp. The whole platoon sure appreciated them 
5,"Okay ladies, I'm going to take a giant leap further than the lady that said &#34;ladies you need this&#34; I say ladies all over the world need this. It's refreshing. If you like feeling refreshed, then this is for you. For personal hygiene, ladies it takes care of all the things that you secretly worry about, or are experiencing. HEY, give it a try you won't be disappointed, I was looking for Tricotine powder, and found out they stop selling it, but this really is better. Plus I couldn't find eve, or massengill in my home pharmacy's, I don't know what's going on with that, but there are probably a lot of ladies walking around thinking they are fresh as a daisy, and are not. I would recommend this product."
5,My handheld was powering on and off after a few seconds. Dyson said it was either the battery or the motor and recommended trying a generic battery from Amazon first. It's done the trick!
3,nothing special
5,"I have been taking this product for 2 years now (off and on of course, can't over do it) and I managed to lose 30 lbs. in the first 1 1/2 - 2 mos.! Then I slacked off and took maybe 2 pills a day and gradually added back in a little more food. I did quit junk food altogerther. But later (and It took a while to even have craving again,surprisinly) I could add in a tiny snack and be fine. I even in the beginning cut down to 1-2 meals a day... I know that's bad, but honestly I'm so used to it anyway cause I have digestion issues. but later I did start adding in like 3-5 really small meals with no issues and no weight gain. This is THE ONLY PRODUCT of like the 20+ I've tried that actually works! And I also like, unlike most, it doesn't make you jittery or headachy or sick..however, on me I have found if I don't eat at least a couple bites when I take it, it tends to make me feel sick. but mostly, i'm fine. Also, after a couple weeks or so I will start feeling sick so it's my cue to hold off a while. I usually, just to maintain weight, take 2 a day for about a week then take a week off sometimes more. So yeah, definitely watch how much you take for sure...don't go overboard. If you stay in low doses and take breaks, it doesn't make me sick or jittery. In the beginning or every now n then when I need to lose a poumd or two I've gained, I take 4 per day. but go down after few days. I also used the Jillian cleanse first too. and every few months I'll take a few days of it just to get rid of some bloat.. It also works really well...not harsh like a laxative. It's a gentle, maybe frequent, normal like, over a couple days kind of thing. I RECOMMEND JILLIAN FAT BURNER. Oh, but stay away from the red bottle one. I've gotten it in by mistake(?) once and I tried it but it didn't do squat! Not even a mild energy., The white bottle like this one does give you a &#34;just right&#34; energy unless of course you take too much you'll notice your heart rate go up!"
5,"I wore them today and my feet felt great all day! I took them off as soon as I got in and my feet feel better than usual, so far I think they helped tremendously! Took a bit getting used to but not much, my feet thank you!"
4,Received the powder...waiting for th e tablets...powder does not mix.well..<br />but seems to work...
5,"Perfect scales, perfect purchasing and shipping experiences. If you are looking for a dependable, quality bathroom scale this is the one. The exceptional shipping and service is a bonus. I would recommend this scales to anyone (under 400 pounds)."
5,"I came across more than one online person claiming that MSM in soap bars and creams helped their skin rebound after weight loss. As someone who is restarting a diet (after losing 32 pounds and maintaining for more than a year), I want to see if it helps with elasticity issues (anyone who has lost a lot of weight knows what I mean...that stretched out and unappealing look of skin that was expanded with fat and is deflated with fat loss). I'll update if I notice improvements by next year (by which time I hope to be down anothe 32 lbs).<br /><br />I do find that it has a nice absorbent, creamy, moisturizing quality. I use it on upper arms, belly, bosom and thighs (I use fragrance free sensitive skin moisturizers elsewhere, except feet, where I like to use perfumed lotions). It absorbs fast and leaves skin nicely soft. Not greasy at all. If it gets in the bloodstream and helps joints, all the better. (I will be starting to take the MSM powder for my aging knees and ankle joints which often hurt after exercising).<br /><br />The scent is light to medium-light (not heavy or annoying) and is herbally (probably from the chamomile extract and rosemary leaf oil.<br /><br />So far, I'd say this is another quality product from Source Naturals. If it does half of what I hear about it, I'll be happy--but especially if it helps my skin's elasticity and health. The price here with S&S is very, very good and this two-pack is convenient.<br /><br />I want to thank the other reviewer for posting about the eyebrow hair-regrow use. I'm going to start trying it for that (if my facial skin can tolerate it, as I do have a supersensitive face with dermatitis/eczema issues). I also have thinning eyebrows since perimenopause and then menopause hit. They've definitely gotten a bit \\""bald\\"" with age. So, thanks for that tip.<br /><br />Hope this review helps those considering this product...be well...<br /><br />UPDATE: The advice for eyebrows is correct. Mine are filling out in the bald spots. :) Now, I also started taking Biotin with this cream, so it may be synergistic, but I had taken Biotin alone in the past and it alone didn't have the effect on eyebrows this combo does. So, whether it's the both combined or principally the MSM cream, dunno. I use a Q-tip to apply. I have had to pluck a bit more. :D<br /><br />I can't tell yet if it is having any good effect on skin elasticity, but I'm continuing with it. I had to discontinue oral MSM due to an allergic rash reaction, but the cream isn't affecting my sensitive system/skin, so I hope it will have good long-term use effects. I did start using a sage and MSM powder mix on my scalp where my hair is thinning a bit post-menopausally, and I hope that since I can't take it internally, that application pre-shampooing will be efficacious.<br /><br />Hope this helps...ream, so it may be synergistic, but I had taken Biotin alone in the past and it alone didn't have the effect on eyebrows this combo does.

5,"My wife is a pampers fan!<br />With a money saving subscription, we've save 100's.<br />This is our daughter's favorite~ she is only comfortable when she is on pampers.<br />Thank you!"
5,i've had lots of enema bags but this is by far the best. being able to see into the bag and the catheter system really make a HUGE difference in comfort and hygiene.
2,"This little book and 3 CD's were not worth the cost. The CD's, which are supposed to be relaxing, are decidedly not of good quality. They sometimes stop cold in the middle of the presentation. Needless to say, that stops any relaxation and startles the listener out of his comfort zone. I am returning them to Amazon."
5,"One of the best-tasting vegan protein powders for your fruit smoothie. Moderately sweet, fairly natural berry flavor. Not too chalky. My son & husband only notice the grey-green color, but don't mind the flavor of 1/2 scoop in their &#34; breakfast milkshakes&#34;. I think the full scoop tastes great."
5,"I take on before I go to sleep and one with my lunch everyday, I feel much better these days."
5,"I really enjoy this and it makes me want to weigh in. Funny, right?!?<br /><br />The only strange thing is there's a slight delay in information getting from the scale to the app on the iPhone. Not sure why and it's not a big deal but it does take a few minutes.<br /><br />Sometimes I am so focused on trying to stand still (Important to get a good reading) and I don't look down in time to see the reading before it shuts off. It would be nice in such cases to be able to see the number on the iPhone right away."
5,"I use these Clorox Disinfecting Wipes for many applications in my house such as cleaning toilets, floors, sink, floor, counter tops, tables, my daughter's toys etc. The strong point is that these wipes are very wet and not semi-wet like other disinfecting wipes. The 'Fresh Scent' gives my house a fresh smell and kills about 99.9% of bacteria and viruses. Also, removing the wipes from the container is hassle free and easy to remove, and the lid stays on tight to preserve the wipes from drying out. These wipes are also great for cleaning your office (keyboard, desk, mouse, phone, etc.).<br /><br />I recommend the Clorox Wipes over the competition since they are more moist and cost effective from a company you can trust."
5,loving it i would recommend every one to this site hands down i will be ordering again really soon loving it
1,"Didn't do crap for me. Then again, I am used to the VERY strong effects of phenibut so maybe my receptors are fried."
5,"The best thing about these, besides getting two in a package and receiving 2 packages for a total of 4, is that the lid actually seals on and can be turned upside down without losing food or liquid. Very good item for the price!"
5,I happened to see this product while browsing and decided to try it after reading about all the wonderful natural healing properties people claimed it has. I'm so glad I did and will make sure to always have some on hand for first aide. Literally the day it arrived my daughter fell off her scooter a nd scraped her hands and knees. I cleaned her up and put this on and she said it made her feel better. Very soothing for pain for cuts and scrapes and with continued use her cuts and scrapes healed very quickly. I'm astounded. It does have a very strong smell like vapo rub but it dissipates in a few minutes. A little bit goes along way and this tiny jar should last a good long while. Very pleased and this is a great product for a great price.
5,Affordable and good quality.<br />Hold up ALL night!<br />I wouldn't change them.<br />Economicos y buena calidad.<br />Aguantan toda la noche!<br />No los cambiaria.
4,They are very good and fun too
5,Love this stuff!!
5,"I actually don't use these all the time for the nighttime yet. I still like the huggies nighttime diapers for that since my little girl isn't potty trained quite yet, and they are easier to get on and off and hold more. That being said, we've used these on trips and they have held up better than the pampers pull up versions. My daughter is skinny - 26 lbs and wears a 2t. The 2t-3t fit her perfectly. I don't know that if she were a chubbier baby they would though. You might need to size up."
5,"I used this in the summer, but then foolishly stopped in the fall. I had not lost much weight while on it, but I have now realized that I look and feel so much better when I am on this product. I need to quit indulging when I am out to eat and no supplement can help me with that. However, this will make you feel and look so much better. I find it really helps in the abdominal area like it promises."
5,My poor 2 week old had a horrible diaper rash (open sores and everything) I tried Butt Paste and Desitin. I stopped using wipes and washed his bum in the sink at every diaper change and nothing worked until BAG BALM!!! Within 2 days the rash was completely gone and his open sores are clearing up. This stuff is the best. I will never use anything else again.
1,"It did not perform as opalescense has in the past. There was no expiration date on it. I used 2 syringes, and left the product on overnight<br />and it did nothing. I asked for a refund."
5,"I particularly like the Fitbit because it works in my pocket. Having to attach a pedometer to my shoes and/or pants led to much searching and some losses, Now I just move it from pants to pants usually with my change."
2,I just got product today was dissapointed to find it has alcohol in it. I will try it but a bit skeptical now. When I think Homeopathic I don't cosider even organic alcohol to be part of it.If I find it works will let you know.
5,"Been using Herpetrol for years - it don't cure it, I have a prescription med for that, but it makes it feel better and keeps the area soft for faster healing. Almost as good as a mothers kiss!"
4,"I used to start my day with fruit juices like orange and pineapple. They would give me a quick energy burst (probably because of all the sugar), but would eventually wear off, making me feel tired and run-down by mid-morning. A long time ago, I switched to spirulina supplement drinks in the morning. mixed just with water. They do a better job of getting me started and keeping my energy and focus up all morning. Here's a good way to start your day: Mix this up with water and drink. (For a more creamy drink, you might try rice milk, almond milk, or coconut milk instead of water. But that does add a bit of sugar). Since you have to wait about 20 minutes after drinking and before eating, that's a good time for some exercise, like a brisk walk. After about 20 minutes of exercise, then have breakfast. I should add, if you don't like the normal \\""green\\"" taste of most spirulina mixes, you might want to try this one. While each person's taste are a little different, you might find it tastes better than the others."
1,It did not work at all. So I will never buy it.
4,"Price was very high, the ad implied it was for 2 bottles when in fact it was only one. Disappointed."
1,"The people that love this must have received a different product! It's horrible. HORRRRRIIIBBBBLLLLLEEEEEEEEE!!!!!! It tastes horrible and the worst thing is that it is too thick. It gets even thicker the longer it's in liquid. I hate wasting money so I've figured out a way to ingest it (in fruit shakes only with a little stevia added). Otherwise, it would be in the trash. This is the worst protein powder I've tasted in all my years of using protein."
5,Been using this for several years. Cheaper and easier getting this via subscription.
5,"I have only used it one month, but already like it more than tampons. I was a little worried at first about getting it out based on some of the other reviews, but really had nothing to worry about. The instructions are very detailed, although the cup is easy to use. Really just place and forget for hours! My heavier days I empty it out about every 6 hours but lighter days I can go as long as needed. I try to think ahead to where I'll be in 12 hours and if it's be easy to empty then. If I know I'll be out and might be in a public restroom, I empty then and know I'll be home in at least 12 hours from that point. It does get a little tricky in public restrooms where you're not right next to a sink, but a cup of water works (although you look a little strange going into the stall with a cup of water). For me I try to empty it at home as much as possible because I still squat down for removal and insertion (maybe others have perfected it in more of a standing position). And squatting is also awkward in a public restroom. Also make sure you have a good grip on the cup when empting, it can get slick and you don't want it falling into dirty water....or maybe always flush before empting.<br />It can be messy when you're emptying it but you wash your hands anyways. I feel much better using this than tampons but I'm the type who has always hated having my period anyway."
5,This is by far the best children's gummy multivit that I have tried. When I've tried others that cost less..they were either too hard or didn't have as complete nutritional values. I always come back to Lil Critters! I also give them the calcium and immunity supplements and they are just as wonderful!! Thanks Amazon!
1,"Did not like the flavor, not really chocolate tasting, just ok"
1,I am very disappointed in the Omron HR-100C HRM; it lasted only two weeks and 8 workouts! and the monitor has stopped displaying my HR.
4,"Very good little gadget ! Easy to use, comfortable grip, for the person the is giving the massage is easy to use, for the one receiving the massage.... Very nice! Relaxing !"
1,Very hard even melting in the microwave takes a while.
1,Stop working after a week.
4,So far - so good! It is doing the job! I have no regrets or complaints. I is a good product!
5,"Oh my, talk about a slice of heaven! ! I was hoping it would be delivered before my weekend and it was delivered sooner!! My only regret was not getting this years ago when I was a waitress! You work hard, get one!! Water heats up perfectly. It drains so easily. Most of all is how amazing your feet and legs feel when you are done. Use it on your loved ones. We all loved this machine! It helps you sleep better too!! Love it!!"
5,this stuff is a Godsend...
4,"This product goes on clear, and is free of allergens which is great for sensitive skin types. It comes in handy on those hot summer days and easily fits in a purse or pocket."
4,As expected
4,its good maca. i have try others and their ok. but this may have a step up. try try it.
1,"If you have ever or do any recreational drugs you will be very disappointed, there is no high or buzz, they are basically just caffeine pills, get a small gut ache an hour after taking and cant sleep for about 5 hours after taking, that's pretty much it, like drinking a pot of coffee. Not worth it."
5,"This is a great product that actually does work! I prepare meals with fresh garlic and also quite a bit of spices! Using underarm deodorant works locally. However, body mint, taken orally, will remove the odors of garlic, strong spices, etc. from the inside out! My husband and I can eat really well seasoned foods and smell just fine with this product! It is a \\""head-to-toe\\"" deodorant!"
3,The vibrator bullet would not adjust speeds very well.
5,Was as described.
5,The Legacy Nutra Garcinia Lean comes in capsule form. It is easy to take and seems to curb my appetite and still gives me energy. I have only been taking it for about a week so it is a bit early to tell how well it works for me. Meanwhile I plan to continue with it.<br />I received this product discounted in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.
3,"Honestly, I've taken a ton of supplements throughout my bulking and cutting phases in bodybuilding. I believe Xtend is definitely one of the best BCAAs to take, but honestly, the taste of blue raspberry is pretty damn bad. It's like I'm drinking splenda (which I hate) with some blue raspberry flavored drops. I never thought I'd ever hate a blue raspberry flavor (I like any candy that's this flavor), but for one, I did... and sadly, it's on Xtend. Get another flavor if you can, but I doubt it'll help (considering their ingredients). This product is as effective for the higher doses you take so it can also get quite expensive, but if you're a hard lifter, this might become a near necessity. Benefits-wise, you can't go wrong. Taste-wise, goddamn, you're going to cringe when it's time to drink up."
5,Love the flavor Orange. Great intra workout supplement as well as being used on off days for recovery.
5,"I have just finished up my 2nd course of IGF-2 along with a few other Applied Neutricuticals products (HGH-Up, Neovar) and I've had serious strength gains in the last 3 months. I have also increased my caloric/protein intake though so it is definitely not a one-bottle solution. Take this review as much for an endorsement of the whole App Nut. stack rather than IGF-2 exclusively. As mentioned it's one of the more expensive supplements but I've had good experience with it. Numbers don't mean much because my regimen is going to be completely different from yours, however: Time Taken: 84 days (with app nut stack) Lifting: 4 days week x 90-120m BF Change: 1-3% drop Weight change: + 17 lbs I'm writing this review primarily to report an unexpected benefit. From the very first night I started taking IGF-2, my sleep cycle was better regulated than ever. I've suffered from an irregular sleep cycle all my life, but once I started dosing 3-4 capsules, say about twice a day, the 2nd being right before bed, I found that I wake up every morning at 6-8am regardless of how much sleep I got. If I'm exhausted I often consciously go back to sleep, but it has somehow given me some sort of internal alarm clock. It's quite noticeable because it will go away if I don't take it for a day, and come back immediately when I start again. It's a major game changer and I plan to consult my doctor to find out if it's safe to take this stuff indefinitely. Maybe it has something to do with insulin control? Who knows."
5,"Thank you Amazon for carrying VegWash! I ran out and used to but ran out and couldn't find it anywhere... I found it again on Amazon and I'm back in business! It does a great job of washing veggies, better than just rinsing them with all the chemicals out there. I use it everyday, and will continue to get this product from Amazon. I highly recommend it...if you haven't tried it yet, you have to!"
5,This stuff is good. I noticed that I became more regular after starting to take this. I've joined the monthly shipment program to see if it works long term. Worth trying.
5,I followed the directions and tried it when I first got it and it registered a 0.00 which was correct. The following week I had 4 glasses of wine in about an hour and a half and tested myself about 50 minutes later. I could tell I was buzzed and I registered a 0.05.
5,"I am super happy with these scales. Being quite nearsighted, with all other scales I've owned I've had to get off and lean down to read the numbers. Not so on the BalanceForm! I can take my weight in the morning before I've put in my contact lenses. And it is super quick. Besides all of these pros, it is beautiful! I love the sleek glass and metal design and the extra large backlit display. It sits heavy and stable on the floor."
5,Great stuff and a good price. It's the best lubricant I have ever used. It has a great sensitivity feeling when applied. It's not sticky like KY. Lasts much longer than Astroglide. Seems to provide continuous lubrication even when exposed to body fluids. It doesn't have have that weird feeling like some silicone based lubricants have.
5,It's Boudreaux's~what else is there to say? :)
5,best oil to use on your whole body! love love this one
3,"NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, BUT IT WAS A GIFT AND THEY LOVED IT."
5,"Using this on the Nexus Rollator. Very easy to assemble, fully adjustable for all different types of drinking glasses/coolers. My father enjoys it very much! Inexpensive quality product. Also shipped very fast!"
1,This product was recommended to me by a doctor so I tried it out. I ended up giving it away because it was really strong. Both in smell and in my system.
4,My fingers and wrists tend curl inward when I sleep. I wore the split with the rigid side facing my palm and it kept my fingers and wrist from curling and it really helped with the pain day to day! I alternate night to night from hand to hand because both my hands have the same problem. I highly recommend for anyone with pinching achy wrist and finger pains.
5,"I have had shingles twice before the age of 40 and they are horrible. I have to say this saved me both times from the severe pain associated with the blisters. This saved me from scaring and made the blisters heal very quickly. I have recommended it to friends, family and even patients at work. Great stuff!"
1,"Would have loved to try this product but it doe contain Legumes (Pea Protein), Rice, and Maltitol.<br /><br />Ingredients: Maltitol syrup, protein blend (rice protein concentrate, pea protein isolate), coconut, almond butter, erythritol,<br />glycerine, digestion-resistant fiber (Fibersol-2), gum arabic, brown rice crisp (whole grain brown rice flour [may have added calcium<br />carbonate]), macadamia nut oil, isomalto-oligosaccharides (prebiotic-fiber), natural flavor, coconut oil, sea salt, alpha lipoic acid,<br />chromium nicotinate glycine chel"
5,"As an allergy sufferer, I can tell you these are the best tissues. Thick, sturdy, and no slimy lotion. Very hard to find in stores though, unfortunately."
1,"Took a chance with this for my wife, even though I was nervous about not being able to replace the bulb. Well, of course it burned out and the light no longer works. Then the sound/alarm clock went haywire and would not turn off. Garbage. Too bad, because it is the only one that is not butt-ugly."
5,"This is the only and best product I have ever tried to keep my rough heels soft. That's right, SOFT!<br />and now, Dr. Scholl's doesn't make this anymore. Ah yes. The retail world - planned obselesence.<br />If they ever re-market this, I will buy up as many as I can get my hands on! FANTASTIC stuff."
5,"I was hesitant to buy a scale on line because I thought it would get damaged in the shipping, but it arrived safely and soundly.I bought the scale in navy blue, and it really is sleek and beautiful. Works perfectly and the digital read out is clear and legible. I like the fact that it remembers the last weight, although I wish it wouldn't sometimes. A good buy."
4,This night split does help with my self-diagnosed plantar fasciitis. When I wear it at night and get out of bed in the morning I don't have the intense heel pain I did before. It's bulky to sleep in but I've gotten used to it. I find that the velcro isn't as strong as it should be and the straps sometimes come undone. I like it more snug so I'm not sure if I pull the straps too tight and that's the cause of the straps coming loose. I often wear it if I'm just sitting around watching TV as well because my foot will tighten up with long periods of rest. There were no directions. It seems self explanatory but it came with a little wedge to put your foot at more of an angle. I couldn't figure out how to get the wedge under the material. There was a little information on the website.
5,Excellent Quality. I will purchase as Lin as company is in existence.
5,"Great stuff, lost 5lbs in the first week, been able to keep it off. Sauna intensifies the effect. Great product, I want to try other products by this Company."
5,Does what is supposed to do.
2,Extremely stiff bristles. Not comfortable for use in shower
4,"I used this medicine more than 6 months, the effect is good. when I used it together with Senna Plus the effect is better."
4,"Four starts because although it did gave me that focus, I had kidney pain after a couple of days. So if you buy it follow all instrucions and take it with lots and lots of water."
5,
4,"Pleasant tasting, I made tea of it. I am impressionable so if I take something for memory and clarity I'll get it for a while even with a placebo, but this kept on working the longer I took it. I'm 76 and there seems to be less tangent in thinking/memory than w/o bacopa.. I'll check back in a month or so to give an update"
5,Love
5,Excellent product.
5,"Love it, good quality"
4,"works as outlined, comfortable, hope in the long term it lives up to advertisement"
5,I have had this product for a week now and have already lost 6 lbs taking 3 one hour before each meal. I am also taking the recommended flax seed 2x per day. I received my free bottles yesterday and am very happy with the results and customer service!!
5,Another GREAT product Made By Pampers!!<br /><br />No Complaints at all!<br /><br />My Son is in the First stages of potty training - and These are a Great way to start!! Like a Diaper and big boy underwear<br /><br />He wears them Overnight and on long car trips and they are absorbant Just like Diapers.<br /><br />However since they are Pull on- and off they are Excellent when He shows a particuloar interest in using the Potty
5,I suffered an injury and was non-load bearing for 3 months. A friend of mine told me about Crutch Buddies and they made my life so much more comfortable while I was on crutches. I can only imagine how sore my armpits and hands would have been without them! I have saved them so that if a friend should need to borrow my crutches I can lend them the Crutch Buddies as well.
5,"I wish that I could give this product more than five stars. I am an African American woman who has thinning edges due to years of wearing weaves and braids that caused a lot of strain on my edges. I have used so many products that promised growth of my edges but this actually works. My edges have have filled in quite a bit and my hair everywhere is much, much thicker.<br /><br />This product does have a strong smell and I use it on my edges once a day and I grease my scalp with it twice a week. It does have a smell to it but do not let this deter you. If you use it at night, the smell does subside by the morning. You have to be sure to massage it into your scalp and you will see results. I have just started on my second tube and I will definitely be purchasing more."
5,"Zarbee's Naturals children's cough syrup + mucus relief - grape flavor does not have Cinnamon like some of the other brands of natural children's cough syrups, so this is a better option for any kids that are allergic to cinnamon (either face or diaper rash). The only ingredients are: blend of dark honeys, zinc, vitamin C, water, natural flavor, grapefruit seed extract (to preserve freshness), and citric acid. Ivy leaf extract is also added to the Cough Syrup + Mucus Relief version to help thin and loosen mucus. Our stubborn daughter does not resist taking it, so the taste must be pretty good. *Note, that it can NOT be used with children under one year old, since it does contain honey. Children one year to five years old are directed to take 1 teaspoon, and children six year old and older, 2 teaspoons per dose. One 4 fluid ounce bottle contains 22 teaspoons, or 22 doses for a child one to five years old. 11 doses for a child six years or older."
5,Appears to be very high quality. The only draw back is the mesh covering over the moving parts. Gets a bit irritating on bare skin. A pillow case solves that problem. Absolutely out standing product.
5,Super Great.
3,This product is more of an appetite suppressant for me. I never feel hungry. Sadly I haven't lost any weight which angers me because I've been working out. :( its a good product over all though.
5,"these rings are very snug, but very stretchy! I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to try something different in the bedroom."
5,helping keep health
5,It is an excellent product that exceeded my expectations and was delivered on time. It is an excellent bargain that was well worth the money spent and recommended to anyone interested.
5,These are worth the extra money. They are solidly built and make a pleasant sound.
5,Great product
5,After taking this for the first time yesterday evening I felt calm and sleepy. Had I been tired I think it may have put me to sleep. Probably best to take at night before bedtime.
3,"The alarm seems to be serving its purpose fine. But the clip is difficult to attach (tight to the alarm unit) - it stretches out the neckline of every t-shirt and pajama top we have, and the cord needs to be taped to the alarm, because it seems to come out rather easily."
5,"Nice product, but I wish it came in a larger size as it runs out very quickly."
5,Couldn't find this in the stores. Exactly what I wanted.
5,Product arrived as promised. So far my leg cramps have subsided. Will probably buy here again.
5,"My physical therapist introduced me to this product when I had shoulder problems. It is very soothing with a pleasant smell. After having shoulder surgery last October, I have continued to use Sombra and it has brought a good deal of relief to my painful shoulder. I would encourage anyone who has aches or pains or surgery to use Sombra. I use the warm therapy, but it also comes in the cool therapy version. My husband also uses the warm therapy for his stiff neck. We both love it!"
5,Comfortable.
5,Love their product! Cleans great and no bleach. Can't find the refill in local stores so amazon was the only place I found it.
4,"Great size, kid friendly, and mostly natural. The ingredients that aren't natural are so miniscule that this product is like 99.9% natural."
4,"Having bought various types of vinegars hoping to find the right one but never did until now. My local hyper market sells various brands of balsamic but some have a heft price tag, the more aged typically the more it cost. Honestly have bought some cheap ones but got a glorified bottle of plain vinegar or was un-naturally sweet. Made a pot of my homemade(from scratch)pasta sauce, while it's also been really good 2 tsp of Alessi made it great. Can't believe the taste it gives to a tomatoe based sauce, was eating by the spoonfuls before adding to the pasta. Wanting to experiment some more, I have been wanting to make some roasted red pepper remoulade to jazz up a BLT or Roast Beef sandwhich. This was the key ingredient even more so than the roasted red peppers. The balsamic cut the fatty taste of the mayo(not a fan of may alone except potato/pasta salad)and added an interesting sweetness but not like sugar. Ate couple spoons of that as well. Not to worry I am not a double dipper even in my own house. I think this will wake up a roast beef gravy and who knows what else. Now I know what to buy and can also afford."
3,"This scent is \\""okay\\"" but I much prefer the White Lily & Orchid fragrance. I hope they bring back the \\""white collection\\"" next spring."
3,thought it would have been able to fold smaller but I guess I may have to purchase a different one that folds or collapses much smaller
2,"This is a very cheaply made product. It is suitable for a child or for a camping trip, but definitely not for a handicapped adult.<br />The bucket is made of very thin plastic, the insert shoot is too short, and the commode lid is so narrow that it does not even completely cover the bucket lid edge. The armrests are very narrow, which is a problem for a handicapped person who needs to push himself up by leaning on them.<br />The width between the legs is only 21&#34; (not 22.5&#34; as stated) which makes the commode unstable. We should have ordered another regular Invacare commode but only the bariatric and heavy duty are offered on Amazon. Previously we have been satisfied with Drive medical, and that is why we ordered from them."
5,"I just love it and it's very easy to carry with your things including document and cash. Light color and light to carry with great quality and design. Everyone, who has seen loved it."
5,I've looked high and low for a replacement battery for my lantern. This one did the trick.
5,Perfect product for curly hair!
5,"well I am on my second bottle .. I had a bad congestion issue , snuffy nose..for at least a year it seems ...not anymore this seems to be the answer to my issue. I have taken many medications including daily allergy tablets...none fixed it ...but this is my answer and it gives me more energy. I actually ordered the immune version by accident I was looking for the Flu version. But this was a Blessing and I will continue to use it ..I have my sister who has asthma using it and it has helped her as well , she recently ordered her second bottle. If you need that health boost ...it is worth it."
5,This product is wonderful for exfoliation. Skin is very smooth after use. Was somewhat skeptical since there is no brush or applicator to use but was surprised it worked just as well as other products that have them. A small amount does the job so a jar will last a while depending on how often you use it. Have used other brands in the past but I think this one is now my favorite. Delivery was within 2 days even though this is not a Prime eligible product. Have since ordered several other products from this vendor and have been very satisfied with every one. I think I may have found my new skincare product line!
5,the inspection said marginal needed pumping and I made deal with seller too not charge him for it and not having it done after a year my septic tank looks like dirty water not chunks;)
5,"Good quality product, doesn't leak, and stays warm for a very long time. I've waken up 4 or 5 hours after I had put the bottle in the bed and it was still lukewarm. Being transparent is definitely a plus."
5,"Exceeded my expectations! Prior mask (similar design) had a back strap design that tended to slip up on my head, causing nasal leakage (and noise). This mask completely cures that issue! As well, prior mask left &#34;morning marks&#34; on my face; and again, this mask cures it. So as you'd now guess, I am completely happy with this Nuance model mask! I awake after 8 hours of sleep with the straps and nasal feature exactly in place as they were when I retired. We &#34;apnea folks&#34; all appreciate the importance of good sleep, so am glad to share this one most positive review with you. Hope you have similar results."
5,This stuff is great! Helps with a good nights sleep is you drink it before bed. I drink it during and after my workout as well. Helps with muscle soreness.
5,I absolutely love my Polar FT4F! It is motivational to see how many calories I'm burning when I do various workouts!
2,"We've had this for almost 3 years now. It seems to do pretty well at filtering out chlorine, judging by smell and how my skin/hair feel. It does make a difference in how both feel. I'd love to see actual measurements of chlorine reduction over time. There's two of us, we take a shower each almost everyday (a bit overkill in my mind, sorry mom) and the filter seems to last 3 to 4 months. But remember there's no quantitative analysis going on here. The whole contraption, with the exception the connections, is plastic. Given the mechanical loads it undergoes it's not surprising that it breaks fairly easily. The housing has fractured on ours with no unusual force being encountered. ( Ahhh epoxy... Wasn't I trying to *reduce* my exposure to something or another? Oops. ) Taking apart a used filter reveals a simple case containing what I assume to be activated charcoal, exactly like you may buy for an aquarium filter with a little bit of paper or synthetic mesh I assume is for sediment. Only thing is that if you did buy this much charcoal from a pet store, it would cost about one tenth what a replacement filter cost. All filters must reduce water flow to some degree. This filter does pretty well here, the reduction is minimal. If you're looking to reduce the odor (at least) of chlorine and don't have kids, and don't mind the steep replacement filter costs, and promise not to ever overtighten anything, nor ever to drop, pull, or stare directly into its eyes then this is the filter for you!! Not awful but not recommended."
1,"I want to buy wheat grass capsules, but all they have here is a picture of wheat grass growing which tells me nothing. Are the capsules organic is it 100% wheatgrass, are the vegetable encapsulated?. Not even a picture of the bottle. For all I know it is a bottle of green colored lead from China"
5,I just love this little purifier/sanitizer. I have several large purifiers for the main living areas of my home but was looking for something small to move back and forth between my laundry room (where the litter box is) and my bedroom where my (sometimes smell) dog sleeps<br />this is perfect & within hours it makes small rooms smell fresh. it makes very little noise and with almost 24/7 use for 4 months it shows no signs of slowing down. will definitely purchase again.
5,No nasty burps!
4,My 2 little dogs have very dry skin in the winer and keep scratching. I heat up a few table spoons and mix in with their dry food. Works great and their cost is soft and silky !
5,"This is far the Best !!!!... I take 0ne in the morning and One afternon 30 minutes before the each meal ... I have be taken this product for two weeks and I lost about 4 pounds....my tommy are getting smaller i love the energy I get, I would recommend it ...."
5,Greenwise Hair Growth vitamins are a welcome addition to my daily vitamin and minerals regimen. I've noticed a significant reduction in daily hair loss and like the healthy texture. Used as part of a promotion and will continue to take. Great product.
4,This is good for a bedroom. Works well and doesn't make a wet floor or countertop. I recommend it to you.
5,"Delivered on time and so far, it works perfect. :)"
1,This scale doesn't work properly and shows more or less then my weight don't ever buy it I want refund
5,Love it
1,"This product made my stomach upset and had to quite using it. Might work for some people, just not me:-("
5,love this but seems to lose its scent quickly.
5,"I never write reviews but I just had to say how great it is to do business with a company that sends out a product the same day you order it and has the product at your home the next day! Hats off to The Access Group, Inc."
2,"Although this face wash product leaves my skin feeling clean and free of oil residue, it has a very strong fragrance, like someone deliberately mixed in a lot of cologne. For me, the scent is somewhat overwhelming, and after trying to hold my breath while using this cleanser, I decided that it is not worth the trouble when there are a few fragrance-free alternatives available. Life is too short to force yourself to use products that you dislike. Too bad, really, as it seems like a good product in other respects."
5,It is perfect. Bought it for a friend who can not bend down to use a short shoe horn. He is thrilled with this.
5,"Jiaogulan has been very well documented as one of the most powerful antioxidants on earth. I take this as part of my daily regimen to control free radical cell growth and lower my blood pressure. It does not in itself offer complete relief for high level hypertension, but it does bring it down a couple points.<br /><br />I add this with Organic Kyolic BP 109, Mercola L-Arginine, QoQ10, Gaia Olive Leaf Extract, Oil of Oregano and Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar for maximum results. I am happy to report that I no longer need my blood pressure meds and my blood pressure is at 117/75. It used to be 145/100.<br /><br />These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.These products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. Consult your physician before taking such supplements."
5,"I bought this supplement to my husband's parents, later they asked me to buy more, so I think this q10 works for them:-)"
5,Great product! Works well! Tastes good!! Just like &#34;ProArgi 9&#34; if you have high blood pressure and you want to get the benefits of this product you have to take it 3 to 4 times a day. Go to Walmart and get a couple of shaker bottles. Put in 8 ounces of water and a couple of ice cubes. Add your scoop of Arginine Infusion and shake it up and drink it down. You will definitely feel the difference.
5,This will make you sleep like a baby! It works great but don't overdo it and don't take it every day or you'll get addicted. I take it only on weekends and it helps my rest tremendously.
5,"I take two prescription medications that have caused me to gain 40lbs and make me constantly hungry. My Dr. won't change the meds, so I am stuck. This product is really helping with my evening munchies. Nothing sounds good if I take it before dinner and early evening. I am ok during the day. My husband is going to try it now too."
2,"I ordered a package that was on sale here through Amazon Local. I ordered the protein package. I am sorely disappointed. I only am enjoying about one out of five of the meals. Many of the chicken cutlets are not cleaned properly of their tendons and grizzle. The spices and/or additives used might make one feel more full yet it often gives me a headache and when I can't eat it because of an odd taste I find that the family dog doesn't want it either. The package did come quickly, in cellophane packages still very frozen yet it is not an easy item to return. I learned that there is only a five day window in which to complain and for me I was still hopeful and sampling the foods during those first five days. I would not recommend this to anyone I cared about. I would only say that it might be better than starving if you are going through an extremely stressful patch in your life. Otherwise the least expensive frozen diet meal like Lean Cuisine in my opinion would be way better quality and when your supermarket has sales would be way cheaper than the Personal Trainer Food. I am writing this long review since this is one of the first Amazon purchases I ever made where I felt the reviews misled me. I really am more disappointed in this than any other item I ever purchased on Amazon or on line period. I also feel badly that there was little recourse for me-the PTF rep wrote to me basically saying I only had a five day window to voice my concerns and that was it. The only frozen food I ever purchased that was as sub par as this was some frozen prepared meals from Walmart--but Walmart backs up their products and PTF does not after five days."
5,They do not vacuum up anything.
1,"Inconsistent readings and not very user friendly. Impossible to get an accurate reading, especially on a small, squirming forehead. Purchased something else instead."
1,"If this is 100% whey pure protein powder, how can it be chocolate?<br /><br />All I am looking for is whey protein, I don't want a bunch of other garbage thrown into it. I can mix it myself. What else is in this? Aspartame? Xylitol? Sorbitol?"
5,"So I've sampled all their soaps, from pine tar to patchouli, and this one is my favorite. I use it for hair, beard, and body. Scent is great whilst showering, but does not linger, according to the wife. Highly recommended."
3,"i kind of regret buying this. I was into the whole wanting to see average sized and chubby women on porn finally, but I didn't know it was gonna be that extreme; the cover is misleading: the majority of the DVDs had EXTREMELY large women, and it made me feel uncomfortable because they werent even that attractive in the face. One of the DVDs had nothing to do with large women, which is fine with me. Just be warned that these are extremely EXTREMELY large women for the most part, although the second halves of the movie have oldER (not old) women and those scenes were pretty good; although they probably just send random DVDs. Aside from that, I'll have to make a review on the masturbator another time, as I got this just for the DVDs. My advice: stick to the ones with PRIME if you have a prime account. The next pack I get will probably be the Latina one, no surprises there. The shipping was pretty good with this one, as it wasn't due for another 5 days. I recommend other DVDs unless you're into 350+ pound women. Take care..."
5,"I take it every morning for a month. I have noticed my energy level increased. It does make me flush however, but not as much as other brands I've tried. All in all a good product."
5,"I was a skeptic too. I was actually on the website purchasing another product for my daughter when I saw this. I was already paying shipping for her product. To add this on didn't add any additional shipping, so I figured why not? I started taking it around mid cycle. I took the doseage as directed on the bottle. Usually everyone in the house knows when I have PMS--LOL. The first month I took this I didn't even know what time of the month it was. I was shocked. The other wonderful thing for me was no premenstral migraine. If you suffer from migraines around your time of the month, you HAVE to try this!!! If I forget to take it I will have a migraine--who knew this would help?"
1,"I have ants in my house, coming from underneath the carpet somewhere. So about 3 weeks ago I placed 6 of this traps around, in the spots where I see the ants the most. Nothing at all changed. I observed many times ants going close to the traps since the traps are on the ants' path. But I have not seen a single ant going into it. The number of ants around the house is identical to what it was before putting the 6 traps"
5,"These gloves are soft, comfortable, and durable. I have only used them for washing dishes so far but I expect I will use them for other household cleaning tasks in lieu of disposable plastic gloves, which tend to leave a dusty residue on the hands. I'm an average sized woman and these gloves fit well. I wash them with dishwashing soap and let them air dry for next time."
5,GOOD STUFF
3,"I purchased it to replace another brand that is currently unavailable. I like that all the ingredients are non-GMO, but I would prefer that it didnt have cornstarch, sorbitol and carrageenan in the ingredients. I will continue to use it until my regular brand is available again as my regular brand does not contain any of these ingredients. Should the formula be changed so as not to include in particular the carrageenan and cornstarch, I would consider it as a permanent replac"
5,Love my Fitbit. I find it good at work when my phone is on vibrate my Fitbit beeps and show the person calling.
1,"Just like everyone else, this product is a nightmare! I have new maple wood floors and I made the biggest mistake of using this junk. The first application looked great...nice shine, etc. BUT, I noticed it left a waxy film on my floors and that every footprint was visible!!! Ugh!!! I will now have to scrub my floors clean with something else."
5,Amazing healing wand
1,"First off let me start with my stats:<br />5'2 female 130 pounds<br /><br />My BF bought these for himself and then decided he still wanted to bulk not lean out so he passes them onto me since that's what I'm working on.<br /><br />I took 1 on an empty stomach as the directions said, within 15 minutes my whole body turned red and felt as if it was on fire. I jumped in the shower stayed under the cold spray, only way to dull the pain. Instantly started to feel nauseous began vomiting as well as my nose began to bleed.<br /><br />I almost passed out in the shower from the burning sensation, and seriously considering calling an ambulance.<br /><br />After 30 minutes of this I was finally able to crawl out of the shower without feeling on fire, laid on the bathroom floor and began shaking, unable to stay warm.<br /><br />Crawled to the couch am still bright red 2 hours later and under 4 blankets.<br /><br />PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS!! Incredibly scary and quite averse side effects."
5,"I have a ciatic condition and do several sports like tennis, biking, hicking, kayaking, swimming and wearing the belt on my hips seems to help release my back. So I recommend spcially this belt. Black colour is prati"
5,"We recently bought a new stove and of course, within the first month I burned greasy food all over it. It took about 2-3 tries with this but it got it ALL off and looks brand new again! I'd definitely recommend this!"
4,"I really love ordering my &#34;paper goods&#34; from Amazon. Somehow, it takes away<br />a great deal of stress, knowing I have: Paper Towels, Kleenex & Toilet Paper.<br /><br />Before trying the Viva brand paper towels, I always used Bounty, Select-a-Size. I<br />was very happy with Bounty, but decided to try the Viva. I like their softness very much.<br />There is a caveat here: When you use the Viva Paper Towels, to clean mirrors, for example,<br />the towels leave &#34;lint&#34;, on the clean surface. This makes realize that although, I like their<br />softness and durability, I will have to go back to Bounty, next order."
5,I was not certain at first but my mind was changed by reults. I am able to eat what I want but not over eat & I have energy to exercise yo burn extra calories! I did have to increase from 2 a day to 3 to give added boost!
5,He has a really hard time with hammer toe on one foot. This has really helped because he wears steel toed shoes.
2,"The texture and the taste of this make it unpalatable to me. I tried experimenting, and I usually use it for smoothies in the morning. The pea flavor is apparent to me even with fruit, and the texture is unpalatable for me. I may still try to experiment with a higher liquid to solids ratio. Currently the only way I've been able to use it at all is to put half the recommended amount, and I still have to force myself to finish it. I'm giving it two stars instead of one because I don't have any problems with whey protein and I understand this fits a need for a lot of people that do. I bought it as an option for an elimination diet."
5,Is saving me money on buying new batteries every month.
4,"Been cycling back and forth between this and USPLabs Jack3d for a couple years now, and have seen some great results.<br />This stuff really gets you ready for your workout, and seems to last about an hour. fewer jitters than jack3d, but less of a \\""rush\\"".<br />Consistent, stable, reliable. Oh, and MusclePharm def has the upper hand on flavors. much better than most preworkout supps on the market."
5,"Lots of energy, Tastes amazing! I have the drive to work out when I take it, and tend to do better/more at the gym. I like it better than C4 because I don't get itchy when I take this!"
5,"You can find a similar belt at a much lower price, but I decided not to save, because this question was about my health.<br />I wanted to buy a belt with a 100% guarantee that it will be able to help me.<br />Thank God, I got exactly what I need.<br />Reliable quality, exact size, 2 days delivery.<br />Matchless effect after the first days of use.<br />Now I use it when I go to the gym."
3,They work like Tums. But a little more pricey.<br />It was convenient to order and save a trip to the drug store.
5,Good price.
5,Great cooking gloves! I am always cutting things so these should keep my fingers safe from getting cut off.
4,of all the slim bars the peanut butter has the best texture. i carry these on hikes and for use after a heavy gym work out. Good protein without a lot of sugar
5,"I love these bottles! Well made, great size and the free gifts were so nice! (Who doesn't like getting something free)!?!? My free gifts were a one ounce spray bottle and a tiny roller bottle... I love tiny things and these are perfect! I am going to keep these in my purse! :) I made magnesium oil spray for my daughter and I and used these bottles to put it in. They are perfect and I love, love, love the way it is more like a mist and not a huge amount comes out at once. I am going to be ordering more to make some room and body sprays. I'm so glad I found these! Thanks!"
4,Wear to sleep.
4,"It works well, only issue is sometimes when on a finger it starts at a low O2 sat and works its way up."
4,"I have had no issues with the unit. I have used in shower, through sweaty workouts, etc. and no issues with the units water resistance. I do try to clean the band regularly though as water does build up in compartment. I tested it on spin cycles, treadmills, and ellipticals, and it seems to give accurate distance measurements for all 3 (taking into account miles run versus riden on a cycle). All in all, I would definitely recommend the unit. Battery life is also excellent."
5,"good for trips, backup"
5,I think this product is very good at cleansing toxic substances out of my system. I would recommend it.<br />Thank you.
5,"I have used this glue for many years (50?) for many household needs, ESPECIALLY for repairing jewelry, china, etc. I was unable to find it in at least 6 different stores that I searched, so was glad to find it here."
4,"I've suffered from joint pains for almost a year now and Penetrex has been helpful in dealing with the pain. It's definitely not a cure and doesn't get rid of all my pain but it certainly eases the soreness in my joints, particularly my wrists and elbow. It's not a miracle product - you won't notice a difference for at least 1-2 weeks after starting it."
5,"I have a thyroid problem and it includes some hair loss. I researched and decided on this product. My hair loss has seen a dramatic reversal. I'm not growing a lot of new, but I'm also not losing any. Love it"
5,"I'm obsessed with these lip balms, so when I saw the entire set I was really excited. It even includes the limited spring addition (the purple one), which is hard to find!...mint is still my favorite, but I love them all....fast shipping. Thank you!"
3,"I bought this to use while whitewater kayaking. I have a Goretex full-body dry suit with a front relief zipper. This device is good for compact storage but that also means it's not very rigid so I was not confident I was able to get it to seal properly through the zipper access while wearing a few layers of clothing under my suit. After a lot of fiddling and several attempts I gave up and didn't use it...I was pretty sure I would have ended up peeing inside my suit. It was also a little short for use with the drysuit, barely extended past the zipper. I have used it camping and it worked fine wearing shorts."
5,"I was a Burt's Bee usurer for years, but this product is better. The smell is so much mor pleasant and it absorbs into the skin at a faster rate."
2,It didn't really do anything except make me bloated.
5,Just what I was looking for! Very nice product! Thank you!
5,"Works as advertised. I cannot attest to the accuracy of the reading or the body fat % chart, but if you are just comparing to your previous measurments, this is perfect."
5,These are great. They work well and are comfortable for all day wear. I will continue to order these ear plugs
5,Terrific product. Arrived quickly and exactly as described. Not wasting money on dryer sheets any longer. Clothes seem to dry quicker and fluffier. I use all six at once. Would definitely recommend to a friend.
5,Great!!!
5,"I swear by these brushes. My older cadmium battery ones finally bit the dust and these are 100 times better and will last a lot longer. Articles out there will tell you that the black light doesn't make much difference in terms of killing bacteria, which is probably true, but I like using the black light and its compartment for two reasons, 1.) it keeps the brush contained so nothing in the bathroom will get on the brush (the bathroom is your dirtiest room in the house after all) and 2.) it dries the brush."
5,"Insoles of course vary from person to person because we all have different feet. Knowing that, take my review with a grain of salt.<br /><br />I have tried several other types and brands of insole, most recently the Orthaheel brand, and these relieve and/or prevent my foot pain more than any other. I suffer from Achilles Tendonitis with a side of Plantar Fasciitis. I like these insoles because they provide the extra arch support I need, and are wide enough in the larger size I buy to work well with my wide feet (my only complaint about the Orthaheels was, while they seem to actually be a better-made product -more sturdy that is- they were too narrow for me and the arch support was in the middle of my foot).<br /><br />They wear out \\""quickly\\"" (depending on your definition), so I have to buy a new pair every 3-4 months. At this price however, that's not a big deal to me, given the relief they provide."
4,"when I buy something that honestly and simply is what is claimed. This bench arrived promptly and already assembled. It is sturdy and does not rock or teeter. It's easy to clean and comfortable to sit on. All in all, a good buy. No frills, it just does its job,"
5,GREAT
4,"Works pretty good after I figured out how to put it on correctly. I wear size 12 mens shoes and it barely fit me but does work fine. I am at the limit in terms of fitting though so, if you wear bigger shoes than mine, it probably won't work for you."
5,Easy to assemble and very sturdy. It is pretty big so be sure to measure your shower/tub to confirm that it will fit before buying.
5,I really love the dryer balls! They are QUIET in the dryer and they really do help fluff the load and improve drying times. I don't have to use a dryer sheet at all. I also bought the Orange and lavender essential oils to scent the dryer balls with. Orange is my favorite. They don't create a strong smell but more of a subtle fragrance. I definitely like the Woolzie balls much better than the hard plastic balls I used to use.
5,"Great, Quality Product! I Love It!"
5,Love my ice wrap
5,Excellent supplement. I started to take it every morning after breakfast and so far has been working well in my body. I totally recommend it.
5,"I just returned from a 13 day safari trip to Africa. The FRIO was perfect for storing my insulin. The original plan was just to use it for the 48 hours of air travel. However upon arrival at the safari camps, the insulin was stored in the camp refrigerator and was not accessible once we retired to our tent for the evening. So after I needed the insulin the first time it went back into the FRIO bag and stayed in my tent or with me for the rest of the journey. It worked great and we were without ice or electricity the whole time."
1,"If I could give Huggies no stars, I would. I have had 4 babies & tried huggies with all 4. They have leaked with every single one. It's like it doesn't absorbed the pee AT ALL! I was sitting on the couch with my 2 week old son, I had JUST changed him & pee ran out of his diaper all over my clothes. I switched to pampers swaddlers then next day & I haven't had a leak since."
5,Long lasting . Makes your shower a bit slick.
1,Shipping is very fast but batteries are not authentic Duracell. They are a knock-off brand that is made in China. Very misleading item description.
5,"This is a superb scent, either on its own or mixed with other essential oils. A pippette is provided, ideal for dispensing very small amounts (which go a long way). Also, the customer service provided by the supplier was excellent. Although the cap broke in transit and I had to request a new bottle, they responded immediately and sent a new, intact bottle right away."
1,Takes to long to actuality heat up and massage not strong enough.
5,good.
5,"I purchased this cane October 5, 2012 and received it on the 8th! It looks exactly like it appears on Amazon. I have already received compliments on its appearance by two people and have only been using it for 3 days. It was easily adjusted for my height, and I highly recommend this cane to anyone who is looking for something that functions great and looks great too. It is lightweight and the handle does not make my hand feel awkward or painful at the end of the day. The only thing you can't tell on the website is how the handle looks. It is pink with the appearance of white and pink ribbons going through it...absolutely beautiful!!"
5,This product exceeded expectations. I wear them all day at work and no longer have headaches from computer glare. I would highly recommend them.
5,This is my second order for these socks and they are just as good as the first time I ordered them. They do not bind on my leg and do not slip down. Good product for great price.
5,Looks good I bought two
5,I love arnica it helps with my swelling in my knees and helps relieve back pain if I am having it
2,"Leaves hair very oily and unmanageable.<br />It is so difficult to style your hair.<br />I think this should be used when you are off from work or just plan to stay home; otherwise, it will be so annoying all day."
5,"I use this as face cream/lotion on a daily basis.This product is amazing keeps my skin glowing and soft. Now that I have found this, I won't use anything else."
1,"It's a fraud. It is nothing like it claims, I'm currently trying to return it. It's not a simple return, therefore confirming my thoughts on it's shady tactics. Amazon should remove items like this. I use Amazon weekly, personal and work account. This makes me re-think my purchases. Especially since I have to go through red- tape to return it."
5,"i hope it can be useful! when i use it, the skin feels a little hot but then cool, so strange"
4,"I own both a jawbone up and a fitbit one. I like both but for very different reasons. The fitbit is great because of it's display and provides info right at your fingertips. I like the fact that you can combine weight tracking as well as activity if you buy the wireless scale. However, the application falls well short of the jawbone up in terms of ease of use, food tracking, etc. They REALLY need a food scanner and better database."
1,Gained three pounds. Doesn't work at all. Don't waste your money. Go to the gym instead...your money is better spent there.
1,"I ordered size medium, couldn't even get them over my toes. Had to return for refund."
5,Fabulous!
5,Totally decreased my numbers (fish oil too). Expensive (so shop around) but worth it.
5,Good brand; size is just as expected.
1,Terrible. My nice didnt like. Wast of money
5,Great product
3,does not remove stains very well
5,"Really work well on your skin, very conductive and sticky. They keep their properties for about a dozen uses in my account, but buy some conductive gel for $10 and you can probably make a single pad get reused for months."
4,"i want to buy cock ring ,but this not only ring your cock also your balls .whatever i can fold the ring and only apply it on my cock."
5,It works great for muscle spams.
2,Did not like the appearance of the neck ties and I ordered the wrong size.
5,Husband is glad we purchased this for him he is on oxygen
5,I love the earthy scent. I bought it for my son to help calm him - works great and he loves it as well. We use it on a daily basis.
1,"I hate where the attachment sits on the pad, either my client's leg or shoulder hits it. It does heat up well"
2,"To be honest, this supplement has done nothing to suppress my appetite. My energy is boosted for a couple of hours, but nothing else is different. I suspect the product works differently with different individuals."
5,"I have used this product for two days in a row after getting a free sample. I am a night owl, but I also have to start my work day at 7am. Yesterday, after only 4 hours of sleep, I took one Power Pill at 6:45am and by 7am, I was wide awake and mentally alert. There was no nervousness or jittery feeling like you get with some other energy supplements. I felt great through out the day. I also take a multivitamin and a B12 supplement in the mornings around 9am. I liked this product so much that I purchased 2 12ct packs on Amazon."
1,"I ordered it from vitacost but they don't allow new reviews. Be careful of the shipping method you choose in hot weather. It was delivered when the temp was 85 degrees fahrenheit and was on the truck for many hours. When it arrived, the bottles were hot. I found the following on the web after I bought it: &#34;It is also important to beware leaving serratiopeptidase on the dashboard of your car or in your car in hot weather. Just 15 minutes at 55C (132F) will deactivate the enzyme, robbing all its health benefits. Always store serratiopeptidase in the refrigerator, with the bottle tightly closed.&#34;<br /><br />Despite this there is no temperature warning on the bottle. I am giving it one star for not having a heat warning on the bottle. I was concerned enough to look for that info when I received it and would have returned it had that info been on the label. I may never be able to judge if it would be effective if it was subjected to too much heat during s"
4,"I have experienced sensitivity to facial products for several years. My skin would turn red, then become dry and itchy before flaking off. After visiting a dermatologist, I discovered DML Forte moisturizing cream on the internet. I have been very satisfied with the results. It is a great product and there has been no reaction since I started using it six weeks ago. Hopefully, I have found a solution to my skin problem. Thank you Amazon.com."
5,"I take these every day. Easy on my stomach. I specifically chose these because they did NOT contain Vitamin D3. Everyone should check their Vitamin D level because almost everyone is deficient and it is an extremely important Vitamin. I was very deficient in Vitamin D so I take the Vitamin D3 at a higher dose as directed by my physician. Because so many vitamins and Calcium supplements add Vitamin D it is easy to overdose on Vitamin D if you are not aware of the Vitamin D level in all of the supplements you take. Therefore, it is better to take the Vitamin D3 in a separate capsule to control the exact level you require."
5,This is a must for any household! I use several Doterra Oils with this diffuser. It has made a tremendous difference in my health.
4,This is very easy to operate. I only which I had gotten the adapter so I could plug it in rather than use a battery all the time.
5,"When I take these, I take four at a time. In so doing, I get 200 mg of Q10, which is a basic minimum dose, and a solid dose of omega 3. See the Coromega website for the published studies of absorption of this stuff. It does absorb faster and more completely than fish oil softgels, with higher blood levels of omega 3.<br />This product causes zero stomach problems, even on an empty stomach."
4,"I really really like these, I just wish they weren't so pricey. Especially when I buy the bulk box of pampers sensitive wipes for like $7, but since these are especially made for face and hands I feel more comfortable using these on my baby's face than regular wipes. I like the 30 pack because they can easily be thrown in the stroller, diaper bag, car (I pretty much have a package in every room of the house which is why the 12 pack was so nice). Just really expensive. It is also slightly annoying that sometimes I pull 2 wipes out of the package instead of 1. You have to be careful when pulling one out. Since they are expensive you don't want to waste them! They are very strong and 1 wipe is usually enough to wipe of my child's face and hands after eating. I use the entire line of Burts Bees Baby, so I will probably continue to use these despite the price!"
5,"I have been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis and being a practicing naturopathic physician and nutritionist, I understand the importance of the amino-acid glutathione in the body. This amino-acid is extremely important for helping to rid the body of free radicals that can cause or aggravate serious disease. It is hard to get into the blood stream via the digestive tract as it is destroyed by hydrochloric acid in the stomach. Absorption through the skin eliminates this issue.<br /><br />Ever since I started using it, I have noted an improvement in mood, memory, and energy. It didn't happen overnight but, after about three weeks, I started noticing a difference. I have been using it on myself for about one and a half months now. I have also noticed that my nails are growing faster and look healthier overall. I plan to use this for some of my more chronically ill autoimmune patients after doing the proper testing to ensure they are good candidates. It makes total sense to me that this would improve function at the mitochondrial level and thus improve overall health. I recommend you ask your holistic health practitioner about this product if you have an autoimmune disease, fibromyalgia, or chronic fatigue."
3,Is different than the one I had from before
5,Sidekick is a very simple and easy device to use. Good price and excellent value to help keep track of blood sugar. Amazon sent it quickly.
4,"I wanted this to prevent my heels from wearing. It does it's job but I wish size was bit bigger other wise, I like it"
2,"Recharging non-rechargeable batteries does not work in many devices. Just cannot charge back to original strength, and doesn't last long."
5,This is what I use every day for breakfast. It is perfect for non eaters in the morning. I was ordering this from a vitamin store for a lot more money. I use the auto delivery for constant must have.
3,doesn't stick well
5,"Curved backdoor toys are supposed to add extra sensations on top of what they are otherwise designed for. These can be curved column dongs which provide a better fit for the naturally arched inner cavities. These can be prostate stimulators, most often in the shape of towers or permanent plugs. Finally, all sorts of curved fantasy shapes are possible too. The point in using them is to tickle a specific spot, hence choosing the right tool for personal anatomy is key.<br /><br />Titanmen Big Stuff Large is a a very simple curved dong. The 62 mm bead at the top gives way to two rings followed by a curved column. The dong is quite heavy, and features a massive base with a sucker, allowing for safe riding once the column is all in. It is a superbly made toy, much easier to use than others of similar girth.<br /><br />Build and Entry:<br />------------<br />Big Stuff Large is quite large, but I could easily imagine a 10 mm thicker dong that would be as easy to use. I wish they had made an XL version. The top bead is 62 mm in diameter, although since it's an ellipsoid, it will be as easy to insert as toys which are 3-4 mm smaller in diameter. The two rings that follow are 57 mm in diameter, followed by a shallow 51 mm gap. From that point on, there are no features on the smooth, curved column, that continues to slowly increase in girth, reaching 60 mm in diameter at the base, at 170 mm of insertable length.<br /><br />Even though 62 mm might sound like much, this is by far the easiest toy to insert among my large collection of 60+ mm backdoor toys. Once the top bead is in, there are no difficulties to come -- it simply slides in all the way to the base. It is really quite surprising! If only some of my other toys were as easy on my bum.<br /><br />Capture:<br />------------<br />Since it's pointless to stop at the gap which follows the rings, the sphincter will be always dilated, anywhere from 50 to 60 mm, depending on how deep the toy is in. The best use of Big Stuff is fastriding. It is not a probe, but since it's significantly curved, it will bang just above the prostate, repeatedly, if the insertor chose to sit on this thing all the way down. I have found that prostate stimulation is more effective if the curved dong is only 2/3 of the way in. As such, I prefer to use it standing up.<br /><br />Exit:<br />------------<br />Now for the fun part. Although it is really easy to extract by hand, I now do it hands-free, standing up. Just letting go of the column will let gravity do its work. Since it's so heavy, it will begin sliding out on its own, accelerating in the process. There will be a slowdown when the bead hits the sphincter from within, and a gasp-inducing plonk will eject the bead also, and the heavy dong falling onto the floor. I can't imagine using this toy and not trying a gravity assisted exit ;)"
5,"I bought this stevia for the first time, a few months ago. I've been using stevia extract powder (1/32 tsp. = tsp. sugar) for almost 10 years and this brand is just as good as the other brands and the cheapest price I've seen around per serving. This is such a great deal compared to the other brands of stevia I've purchased in the past. A pound (16 ounces) of stevia extract powder for $40 is such a great deal. The Now brand sells for $55-60 a lb. and around 7-8 years ago I paid more than that for that size bottle at a local health food store and it lasted me more than a year (I was only able to buy it once from that store like that. They no longer sell the big bottle like that. They use the bottle to repackage in smaller zipper baggies and sell by the ounce. They were surprised I wanted to buy the big bottle which they did have a price on.) The last few years, I was purchasing a 3.5 ounce bottle of the Kal brand for $28-30 at another local health food store and that much wouldn't last me 2-3 months. I use a lot of stevia, mostly for my cold green tea with lemon, which I drink like water, from 1 to 1 1/2 liters of tea a day. Also, I refill an old small (1 oz.?) Now bottle of stevia, and carry it around in my purse for sweetening unsweet tea in restaurants, which I use about once or twice a week. I also use stevia to sweeten coffee, which I had only been drinking once or twice a week but lately I have been drinking coffee more often. As far as the taste and sweetness, it's just as good as the other brands like Now and Kal. It's just as good as the store brand that I bought for several years from Vitamin World, which they used to sell a few yrs ago (which they don't anymore, they use a more \\""watered down\\"" stevia powder now). The Kal brand is slightly sweeter but a lot of times I was easily using too much of that brand anyway. If I was using 4-5 scoops of Kal brand to sweeten a large glass of tea in a restaurant, I may need to add an extra scoop or two of this brandto get it just as sweet but this brand is still such a great deal and I'm less likely to use too much. It's been awhile since I've used the Now brand but far as I can remember it's similiar to Kal brand but Kal may be slightly sweeter. Again, this is the best deal around on stevia. The best price and just as good as other brands. I still have a lot left and will definitely purchase this brand again. It may be a year before I need some more but this brand is dated 1 1/2 yrs from now (which I've already had half a year). I'm sure it would still be good long after the sell by date but I'll have it used up long before the date. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this stevia."
5,I use it every day and it cleans and whitens the best! Very easy to use and you can be sure your dentures will be clean and white!
5,Love Jarrow's quality!!!!!!!
5,"My 5 year old doesn't like the &#34;crunchy outside&#34;. There is a layer of sugar coating each piece. I think she is used to vitamins that are smooth like gummy bears. So, I've been eating them. They taste fine-no fishy smell or taste at all-they are tart and sweet. The consistency is a bit stickier than a typical gummy bear type vitamin-maybe not the best thing to gnaw on before bed."
4,These are decent but I recently found some that have double the IU for around the same price so I've switched.
5,"this product i bought was recommended from one of my Dr. friends. he said all the cholesterol pills leads to major side effects including zahaymer disease, it kills the brain cells. so he said use these pills while using your cholesterol pills as every other day. so i made my mom consume 2 pills of this each 3 days before bed and the 4th day is her cholesterol pill, after a month period checkup, her cholesterol was perfect, she continued but this time each 4 days of this pills she takes her cholesterol pill and the readings was an extreme perfect. this pills works very well and as prescribed it's natural. i recommend anyone who has cholesterol to use it BUT:<br />1- FIRST, ask your doctor about your new plan.<br />2- have a blood test before consuming these pills (including cholesterol)<br />3- NEVER leave you cholesterol pills, just accompany both as u work your way up till you stop the cholesterol pills.<br />4- NEVER rush it, u've been living with cholesterol pills for how many years!!! so take it easy and work your way up month by month till you reach it.<br />one last hint, the Dr. told me to give my mom the CoQ10 pills every morning because the cholesterol pills accelerates ageing, so it increases wrinkles. CoQ10 pills recovers from it (that's what i remember.. i guess) so i gave her a pill of CoQ10 in the morning and 2 pills of this Yeast at night, and she feels super good.<br />last but not least i wish you all good health, we have tried it and it worked miracles."
5,"I eat pretty healthy, but I occasionally eat junk food. The manufacturer contacted me and offered me a free bottle in exchange for a fair and honest review. I was up for it.<br /><br />There's always a bit of trepidation when taking something like this because I don't know if there will be weird side effects. I followed the instructions carefully and felt no side effects.<br /><br />This product has been uber effective, and I feel great.<br /><br />There are a lot of natural ingredients in here, though I would prefer the capsules did not use gelatin. Still, this is a product I can heartily recommend."
3,great product but have kicked and stepped on it on accident due to its low profile and invisibility. Works as intended though.
2,"I ordered this product and payed for fast shipping in order to try it sooner. It didn't arrive in the time promised, I had no return communication from the company, and when it did arrive the next week it had been shipped 1st class mail. How is that expedited shipping? The product may have helped my hunger some, but not as much as I wanted. Also it claims it's a 35-40 day supply. Not even close. I have been using it as the bottle says (6 drops, 6 times a day) and it's about gone after 2 weeks. Ridiculous! I suggest trying a different company. This one is frustrating!"
5,"I've had trouble finding foaming soap refills, and ordered a box of these. This should last me about a year (we have 2 people in our household). The scent is light, and it foams beautifully. Not as much recycling or cost as buying the whole foaming soap bottle each time."
5,"I have a nasty habit of falling asleep with my glasses on, and other times they simply slide off my nose. Either way they wind up on the floor or under me - neither of which is good for the glass frame. The Peeper Keepers keep the glasses from falling any farther than my chest, and neither can they swing underneath me. Glass frame saved. From other reviews I've read, the ability of the retainer strap to stay on the glasses is an issue. These do not suffer from that problem. They stay in place wherever you put them; yes, sliding them in place takes a little bit of effort, but they don't move either. And the material they're made from is comfortable enough against the skin. A good, basic product that is well made and works as intended; at Amazon's price for a three pack, its a bargain as well."
3,"Arrived in an enevlope and not well protected. They fit smaller feet better than my mens size 10-1/2. A littler uncomfortable at first but you get use to it. Chtches the sheet on the bed so if you are restless, think twice before buying them."
5,It provides overnight relief as stated.It has a natural vegetable ingredient. I have used it for many years and it always works effectively.
5,I highly recommend this prodcut..just be sure to follow directions and apply a good amount to specified area. Usually takes about an hour to go into effect.
5,Good buy. Excellent service
5,"This wheelchair cushion is very comfortable, and fit right in my manual chair without adding too much bulk. Thank you."
5,Great
1,"When I opened the package I could tell the product was definitely not new. When I tried the product, nothing worked correctly, and it would not even stick to the side of the tub. I had already throw the box away so now I'm stuck with a piece of junk that will just be thrown away after 1 attempt of being used."
5,"I've only been wearing this for a few days and I'm already noticing a difference. If this product seems to work strengthening my nails, I will definitely order again! The shipping was a day ahead of schedule as well."
5,"It works as advertised. It is small, easy to use, inexpensive, and has saved me money on the first use. I wasn't sure if a battery was good or not and it immediately let me know it was good. I would have tossed the battery."
4,"[[VIDEOID:mo2Z765I8AEXTOX]]I have the Reynolds vac sealer that I bought over a year ago as well. That works just as well, however they no longer sell it in my area, to my knowledge anyawy,so when I saw this pump I was curious. First of all, you can't beat the price. The refill bags are reasonably priced as well. I purchased them at a Walmart in my area. The pump and the battery powered Reynolds sealer are comparable to each other in function. I have used the pump many times and have had one instance where there seemed to be some air leakage; to remedy the problem, I re-pumped and placed 2 strips of tape over the pump entry point- so far so good. The way I see it, even if it doesn't work 100% all the time, it still gets more air out than using an ordinary zip seal bag alone, and at such a cheap price, I feel it more than pays for itself.<br /><br />In the video, I demo both the Reynolds and the Ziploc so you can see how they match up to eachother. Also, you'll notice that the Ziploc bags can be used with the Reynolds sealer ,which is good to know if the Reynolds bags are no longer available in your area, and you own one too."
5,"My toenails had gotten thick and slightly yellow, so I decided to try Kerasal Nail to see if it would help. After just a week or two, my toe nails were clear, the thickness had returned to normal, and they were no longer brittle. It's simple to use (just apply to clean, dry toenails by rubbing the applicator tip over the nail, around the cuticle, and along the open edge of the nail once a day, at bedtime), and there's no staining of socks, sheets, or other fabrics. No strange odors, no weird sensations, nothing. Just let it dry for a few minutes before putting socks on, if you're going to put them on after applying the treatment."
5,"As someone who is normally hesitant to use sleep aids, I am glad that I have finally found one in Active Rest that I feel comfortable using. Many sleep aids are loaded with unidentifiable drugs, but Active Rest's simple and wholesome formula assures me that I know what I'm putting in my body. Now, after several weeks of using the product, I have seen first hand the benefits of taking Active Rest before going to sleep each night. I no longer wake up groggy, but instead hear my alarm and get right up out of bed to start my day. And, since I'm getting better sleep, I'm also drinking less coffee, so I would also recommend this product to anyone trying to reduce their daily coffee intake."
5,"My daughter and I love these. Bath towels were just too heavy for my head and would not stay on my head. These do a good job drying my hair, too."
1,My heels kept popping through the opening and they were unwearable as they slide off the heel while walking through the grass.
5,An excellent aid for my 81 y.o. mother! Beats the walker and rollator. Also the price was fantastic. Mom loves how easily the cane stores away in it's bag. THANKS!
5,I ran out of this during the summer and actually forgot about it. Then I noticed that when I would squat down my knees sort of locked up and I had to get help getting up. Ordered some more of this and in a week my joints were much better. Making my husband try it now!!!
5,"I got into Zyflamend when a health food store employee whispered to me that it was their main item that really worked. I believe taking it regularly reduces the pain in my right hip and knee (which got messed up compensating for a broken coccyx years ago.)<br /><br />FWIW, more dramatic praise came from my garage mechanic. I gave him--a Vietnam vet with no knee cartilage--a box for Christmas and he said it was the first thing that had allowed him to walk around without pain. He recommends it to his other creaky customers now."
5,"Blood Urine Reagent Test Strips Urine Reagent Strips (URS) is great... it's fast, simple and accurate. Would absolutely recommend ist to anyone who needs to find out about blood in urine."
5,"This is a review and two questions. My review: The manual says to be careful when I cut the tube to fit around the ear. Well...I cut a little too much, and so the tube is too short now. I called the company and explained the situation. The tube kit, which also includes dome-shaped plug, is $25.90 for pair. plus $3.95 S&H. So, be careful when you cut the tube because they don't sell just the tube. The customer service also said that they sell a thin tube kit, which they say is more invisible, for $34.90. plus $3.95 S&H. I guess this is a must because, although I was impressed with how well it worked, I was a bit disappointed with the size, and how visible it was. My questions: How do I make sure that tubes don't fall off. When I pull out the plug, the tube often gets disconnected. Is it ok to glue it? That is, I carefully use crazy glue so i don't clog the tube. Another question is about the setting. H is for those who have sloping hearing loss. But what if I have a little bit of both? I set my volume to about 1 and 1/3 under N. it gets too loud if i set it to 2. So, i guess my hearing loss isn't that bad. but it gets worse when there are distractions like in outside. Are there many people who switch from N (low pitch) to H (High Pitch, distraction) when they go out in a crowd? And then, back to N when they come indoor?"
3,"I use these to cleanse a tender area on my cat, who is sick. I have used competitive products in the past that are much softer. These do the job, and they are sturdy enough, but they do feel a little rough to the touch."
5,smells great
3,"So-so. It's a little to big and not stretchy enough. A better choice is the Doc Johnson Titan Cock Ring, which has a smaller unstretched diameter, but is stretchier material with just the right elasticity. The Titan also has a wider, more effective band. I've kept this, but don't really use it."
5,"I mainly bought this for my dog who can get really anxious due to pending storms, noises, smells, you name it! I give her 4 - 6 drops and the results are almost immediate! It doesn't knock her out or make her pant like Rescue Remedy and she likes the taste. I've tried it too (6 - 10 drops) when I'm wound up and cannot sleep. It seems to work for me too."
5,"I rarely write reviews. But this time is different. Yes, the company did send me an offer where if I write a review I get a free bottle. I waited until I neared the end however to write this review. If it didn't work why would I want a free bottle. I have been taking this couple with weight gainer pills and excercise. I cannot believe the results really work. I have only been using the pills, not the cream. I am hesitant to use the cream as the price is a little too high for me to buy both. However, I will continue these pills for 6 months, and possibly use one bottle of cream. I have been getting compliments on my ass which is new to me because Ive always been flat. And I cant stop looking at my self in the mirror lol. I do recommend trying this.. however, you need to be consistent. Like I said I took this coupled with weight gainer and excercise which I recommend for you too for best results possible."
5,Amazing product! And yes it stays in Fahrenheit mode!!!!!
3,"the cuff seems to be working just fine, and it seems accurate. The only problem I have is very minor, it takes longer to read your pressure than most....but we all want things in a hurry these days!"
4,quite strong vibrations for such a baby
5,"I was skeptical, regardless of all the other reviews because a protein powder always tastes &#34;grainy&#34;. At least, you come to expect that & accept it whenever you buy. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this one! I ordered the Vanilla because I mix with coffee &/or juices so I wanted an easy flavor. I blend in my Nutrabullet with about 8oz juice/coffee, a few cubes of ice (more if it's coffee), & a scoop of powder. NO grainy texture, gives it a &#34;frappe&#34; texture if you have to visualize it. Smooths out great, blends great, super happy!"
1,"I bought this product in December, 2014. It worked fine, until I threw the box away. Then it would start to heat up, but before 10 minutes passed, it would start flashing the red light, heat indicator, and never get hot. The only way to stop the flashing is to disconnect at the wall. Doing so at the connector will not work. It will flash all night if I don't unplug it. There is no response whatsoever from the switches. I have tried it in all of the heat settings, with the same result. Very disappointed.<br />Linda Warrick"
4,"This ingredient worked well on me when I was younger. My problem is, I never take it on time any more."
5,"Having read reviews of other foot spas but never having tried one, I was skeptical because people had a lot of unexpected complaints. You'd have to be pretty picky to find anything wrong with this, though. I sat studying for at least half an hour and the water stayed warm, and the vibration is just right for a longer soak. The pumice stone and foot rests for giving yourself a pedicure are handy, too. All that and it's one of the cheaper models, I'm sold. =)"
2,I by mistake ordered the CR2450 and I really need the CR2430 which I'm going to order. Jim Sullivan
4,"As this tp is recommended for septic systems, I decided to try it. You get a big roll and the paper is one-ply, very thin. I'm sure it will do as it says. Although it's not soft and cushy, it does the job and should extend the time to have our septic tank drained. It is probably more economical than many tps and you don't have to change the roll as often."
1,Just didn't work for me....sorry
1,"These did not work well for me. In fact, they seem to have made things somewhat worse. Perhaps other people will have better results."
2,"Not accurate for me at all! I'm 8 months pregnant and every time I go to the doctor, my blood pressure is borderline high (130/85). Using this wrist cuff at home, my blood pressure consistently reads about 120/70. I wondered if I was just nervous at the doctor to I went to Costco and bought the arm cuff. The arm cuff is consistent with my doctors readings. Not sure why this product is so far off but I will not be using it anymore. It's a bit scary that it's giving me normal readings when my blood pressure is not normal!"
5,"I have been using this for about five days now and mine is almost gone. I apply it about 3 times a day. UPDATE: Its been about a month, one is completing gone and the other one is still there, I am hopeful. I apply 3-5 times a day."
1,"I'm pre-menopausal, so I was looking for a product to help reduce my newly acquired belly fat. I've always been very thin until recently. After taking this product for two weeks, I lost no belly fat, but I did develop huge cyst-like bumps on my back and forehead. I also suddenly became very tired, even though I wasn't sleeping soundly. I took the medicine exactly as prescribed. I think this is dangerous medicine and I do not recommend it. I'm 45 and I'm still trying to deal with the cystic acne on my back. I have never had acne until now, even as a teenager. Hopefully, my fatigue and acne will subside soon, but I'm still trying to recover from this horrible experience."
1,"Worked the very first time, but every time since has given me an error code. Don't waste your money on this monitor."
5,Excellent product and transaction...Thanks!!!
4,This product does just what it says. I only wish it lasted a couple more hours.
1,Does not fit all walkers
5,We use the finger pulse monitor fairly regularly. We are heart patients so it is a very useful monitor. I think it is useful and is simple to use.
5,"I have issues with joint pain in my knees due to an injury when I was younger, and although I'm only in my late 20's, I still suffer quite a bit. This has definitely helped me out."
5,"I bought my unti 11 years ago. I use it frequently, and it is still working really well. It has held up amazingly. Its well worth the moeny"
5,"I tried to save time by purchasing another brand sold in a very large discount department store. I tried this other brand for 3 days with the same result. I became so sick to my stomach after taking it that I went back to the Natrol brand. I noticed that one of the ingredients came from a plant source rather than animal. For people like me, with allergies, this may have been the problem. Whatever the reason, the Natrol brand is perfect for my needs and I won't be experimenting again."
5,Item was exactly as expected and a good purchase for the money. Would recommend it for purchase. Do not purchase your test stips at your pharmacy anymore..... You get a much better deal with Amazon and the expiration dates are usually a month or two out from expiration for product. The last order I received the expiration dates were at least a year out from expiring.
4,It's hard to tell but I think this has given me a bit more energy.
1,"You will only be in for a lifetime/one year of suffering, misery, and inevitably throwing this printer against the wall. The satisfaction you get from throwing the printer will make that the most useful thing the printer ever did."
1,The clipper worked for less than one minute and it burned up.
5,"These have been delicious so far - only gotten through a couple of the flavors, but I love the product. It's a very protein- and fiber-rich supplement bar with much better quality ingredients than most other bars on the market right now."
5,Great price for sprouted quinoa - equivalent to non-sprouted I found elsewhere. Great product.
5,It does helps a lot for my back pain and my feet! Great product!!!
5,There are tons of positive reviews regarding fish oil that show the immense qualities of this natural product.
1,Absolutely no improvement.
2,"Had no effect for my neck and shoulder problems, unfortunately, and was quite expensive. Everybody is different though, and it might work for you."
5,make u real hard
5,This was used by my 7 year old grandson. He said it tasted great and that it worked pretty fast.<br />He has back problems and has already had 4 surgeries. He is in a lot of pain daily. I decided to time him one day and the Advil did seem to take effect faster than other pain relievers. I received a free product for purpose of my review. All opinions are 100% my own.
4,"I thought this item was going to be bigger, my mistake. It does say face & neck massager.<br />I was looking for something similar (but bigger) to work the knots out of my upper & lower back muscles.<br />Nicely made piece of kit though & I'm sure my neck will benefit from a massage."
5,Great taste and can fell the energy
5,"The reviewer who advised looking at other sites was right. Amazon was the only place excessive negative reviews were placed on the basis that the product was manufactured in China.<br /><br />After reading negative spirulina reviews based on how \\""horrible\\"" the product tasted, I tried 1 teaspoon with 1/3 cup of Silk plain cocoanut milk (6 grams of sugar per cup) so only 2 grams of sugar if sugar is a concern of yours. To my surprise it tasted great!. There was to my taste buds no fishy, seaweed pond scum, etc. taste whatever! Most of it dissolved but not all. Still the excess was still semi mixed with the cocoanut milk and that went down fine too.<br /><br />Don't forget too that to get the organic seal a product has to meet strict standards.<br /><br />Since this is my first try at this product, I will revisit this review in 6 months and post an update regarding effectiveness vis a vis any improvement in energy levels and the like."
2,"like the pipe, stem didn't last long."
5,"I've had a couple of scales before and none of them were as accurate as this one. And at the price, it can't really be beat. Also, their customer service is AMAZING so you can be sure that if you have a problem they will figure it out for you at no cost to you."
5,Item was exactly as ordered and the watch is now running again. Couldn't ask for more from a battery. The fact that I now have 4 spares means that I can go a few years without having to buy locally again.
5,"I'd been searching for a good brand that sells chelated magnesium for about a year now. It's hard to find locally and many online venders also use alternative formulas.<br /><br />Anyway, this magnesium seems very effective. I generally take it with dinner and it helps me relax and get better sleep. This is currently my brand of choice for magnesium."
4,"Mainly take this for lack of supplements being a truck driver. It does help, don't feel groggy or out of energy. Still to early to tell if its working. Taste is kind of hard to get use to though. Kind of gritty when you reach the last drop. Lasts about 2 months if I don't take it during the weekends. If you don't like taking pills, this is perfect for adults and children."
5,Leaves my skin with an amazing glow!
4,"Wasn't sure what to expect but definitely feel a little more energy running through my veins, I thought I'd feel more energized but I'm only about two weeks in so maybe it'll pick up, I started with one a day and now moving on to two a day so lets see where that takes me.<br />So far so good though, have nothing negative to say!"
5,"I use this in my Nutrablast shake every morning with a handful or spinach, carrots, water and a tiny bit of frozen berries. I have also been using it 30 minutes after boot camp in the evening with some vanilla coconut milk."
5,"I used to hate wearing contacts because as I used the same pair more they felt so unnatural in my eyes. As soon as I switched to this, its cake. Feels like a brand new pair every morning. Don't be an idiot and put the hydrogen peroxide in your eyes, and you're set. My monthly use contacts last me about 3-4 months now, because they never feel bad, are blurry, etc. Saves me money and makes them feel great."
3,had little effect on me
5,"Absolutely the best price for this excellent product,"
5,"Arnold iron pack comes in 30 plastic wrapped pack of vitamins. Each pack has 10 pills to take per day. I'm still on my first box. I feel a bit more energized. I enjoy taking them , but I probably won't buy anymore. You're spending more than $1 a day for this. Unless I'm getting paid to train I probably can't keep buying this."
5,the cinnamon sent is awesome the warmth and comfort that this oil brings its amazing and IT just makes me feel great knowing that this particular blend is able to kill viruses and microbes around me Use it in my diffuser.

3,Its an okay product. Works well when not interacting with another product.
5,"My mom's hospital mattress was too soft and bless her heart, this one is firm and it works for her."
1,"This not curcumin, it is turmeric, the same spice you can buy 10lbs of in the supermarket for what they are charging for 120 capsules. Shame on you \\""Doctor Danielle\\""<br /><br />Buy a pound of organic turmeric here [[ASIN:B007YFKO1E Organic Turmeric Root Powder]] for the same price as these \\""Dr Danielle\\"" frauds are selling one TENTH of a pound of turmeric."
5,This is a good quality Magnifier which can enlarge size up to 3x. The 3 super bright LED lights will illuminate the entire page and user can be read book or map at night without disturbing others anymore! This quality magnifier also able to relieve eye strain & fatigue. Thanks for the manufacturer!
5,I ordered this to mix my Vitamin C face serum in. It's the perfect size for a month's worth of serum and the dropper makes it easy to apply the serum to my face in the morning.
1,"Not enough cushion, possibly too soft, and felt like it was always slipping when you sit in it."
4,worked well on a cane that could not stand. better support
4,This soap will be a stocking gift to my husband so I haven't tried it yet. Although the scent is amazing. I'm sure he will love it!
5,This crusher work grate compared to the rest
5,"I absolutely love the swiffer vacuum. I bought it a few years ago when my neighbor told me that she can't live without it and she took it ever overseas when she goes to visit! and she took it as a gift too. So, since I just love vacuum and cleaning products and gadgets, I had to have it. I purchased one the same day and I came home and charged and couldn't wait to use it. What I love about it is that I can wet the towels and use it as a mop while I vacuum. I even use sometimes different materials as mopping cloths. I use it every single day on my wood laminate floors. And I have had it for years and still works perfectly."
2,Did not work for me
4,"I mix it with a banana, PB2, soymilk, and 6 ice cubes for a morning shake. It's very good and satisfying."
5,I am very happy with this item and it gives me lots of energy during the day.

1,"The seat that attaches at the arms broke the 3rd time it was sat in! The bubble wrap was still in place on the wood. I bought this as a 1st year anniversary present for my husband, I hope this was not a sign of what the second year will bring!"
5,"I bought this on a fling. I was not very up for the idea but<br />Really, All I can say to describe this product is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!<br />I thoroughly enjoy this product."

5,"Great bags, great price."
5,"It's an office folder....not too much to get excited about. EXCEPT I couldn't find any around here with only 7 pockets. They all had 13 pockets, extra &#34;storage&#34;, etc. I use them for recipe....yellow for cheese/eggs/appetizers, red for all meat, green for vegetables/ vegetarian meals and pink for desserts. Now bright blue will be more sweets and black might be.....chocolate!"
1,"I was shocked to read the ingredients. The product is labeled as \\""homeopathic\\"" with \\""probiotics\\"" but is full of harmful chemicals! Bluntly misleading!"
4,Works as described. Handles are nice. I'd use better quality screws if you are screwing into hard wood.
5,I've shopped around a lot... this is the best price for a good product. Worth buying them through Amazon!
5,ALL EXCELENT
3,I have been taking these for a little over a month.<br /><br />It says take 3 times a day. I am use to taking multi - vitamin that is only one a day so I normally take these once maybe twice a day morning and around lunch.<br /><br />I do feel a little bit of energy but not sure if its placebo. I tried taking 3 times a day but that is just too much maybe im just lazy but I think its crazy. sorry I can be more helpful but I just don't see a big difference.<br /><br />What i do have is a cool toxic yellow urine!
5,"In spite of the controversy on the shave boards you either love these cheap efficient cutting blades or you hate em and want to use your PERSONNA HOSPITAL grade blades at 6x the price.<br />I use em and get 3 to 5 shaves from a blade. I have medium hair growth and let my beard grow for a few days between shaves so the blade gets quite a cutting workout.<br />ATG, WTG, XTG...is my method.<br />Prep is VERY important!!!<br />Wash your face with soap. Use a good lathering tallow soap or cream...let the lather sit on your wet, clean beard for a couple o minutes and shave away.<br />Tom"
5,Use it every day and still going strong.
5,I lent one of these to a friend who's spouse was dying and on Hospice. it did exactly what was needed to keep mattress from being soiled. I prefer it over the disposable products as I consider this more environmentally friendly.
5,"I haven't had it long, but the scale works great. The scale knows who is on based on weight, which makes it easier. The color indicators are a nice touch. It already comes with batteries, and it's very sleek and lightweight."
5,"As I've written in other reviews, I have a very dry nose with crusting/bleeding that never really goes away. I've tried using a neti-pot, humidifier, and saline sprays, but none of them really seemed to help. I've tried Ponaris, which is pretty good, but I stopped using it because it's uncomfortable to use every day and has a strong aroma.<br /><br />Nozoil works nicely because it's aroma-free, and feels quite mild in the sinuses. I use it in conjunction with Rhinaris Lubricating Mist, and it has REALLY helped. Would absolutely recommend to anyone with a dry nose."
5,"it shipped really quickly, this is the second time I make a bulk purchase of this product.<br />i tried to tell my uncle that the dosage of lutein is small and preservision has more, but was not succeesful"
5,"Can't live without it! Perfect for neck and shoulder pain. Also, helps with migraines."
5,I've purchased these glides previously and will continue to do so. They glide smoothly on all surfaces and last for quite a long time.
5,"good deal, they are 9 volt batteries, and they came in a glorious storage bin that you can keep as a collectors item or recycle it."
1,All the bottles are expired
4,"I seem to be resting a good bit better. I have sleep apnea and acid reflux, and it does seem to help so far. Will add more comments after it`s been in use a longer period of time"
